\subsection{Literature Search}

To identify relevant studies, bibliographic searches were performed in Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library and Scopus databases.

Relevant studies were identified using electronic bibliographic searches (up to date as of January 2016) in PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and EMBASE. 
MESH terms and all-field search terms were searched for ``Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma'' [head and neck, pharyn*, hypopharyn* oropharyn*, laryn*, oral, tongue][squamous cell carcinoma, carcinoma, cancer, tumour, tumor] AND ``margin'' OR ``margin assessment'' or ``margins of excision'' [MESH] %Check the mesh headings to include here - do they match the terms I used? 
The search included all study designs. 
Potentially relevant studies identified from bibliographies of manuscripts included in the full text screen were added to the database of studies to screen. 
Individual searches were also performed in Google Scholar as suggested by full text screening no further potentially relevant studies were identified for screening. 
No limitations were placed on the search date range. 
The last search was performed in October 2021.


Two investigators (JAH and OB) screened all titles and abstracts independently. Any title or abstract identified as potentially relevant by either investigator was included for full-text review. 


\subsection{Inclusion Criteria}

Any study that included diagnostic margin assessment data provided by one or more intraoperative techniques used during curative surgery for HNSCC in adults (mean age \textgreater 18) was eligible for inclusion.
Studies were only included for meta-analysis if they provided raw diagnostic data (true positive, false positive, true negative, false negative) for the index test compared with permanent section histopathology or sufficient derived diagnostic metric data (total sample numbers, sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV) to reconstruct the raw diagnostic data.

\subsection(Exclusion Criteria}

Abstracts, conference proceedings, opinion articles, case reports, reviews, meta-analyses were excluded, as were articles that were not available in English.
Studies not performed in humans or not in an operative environment were excluded. 
Studies were excluded if they did not report raw diagnostic data, or sufficient derived diagnostic metric data 

Disagreement regarding article inclusion was resolved by consensus.
