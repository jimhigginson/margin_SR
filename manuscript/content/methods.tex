MESH terms and all-field search terms were searched for ``Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma'' [head and neck, pharyn*, hypopharyn* oropharyn*, laryn*, oral, tongue][squamous cell carcinoma, carcinoma, cancer, tumour, tumor] AND ``margin'' OR ``margin assessment'' or ``margins of excision'' [MESH] %Check the mesh headings to include here - do they match the terms I used? 
The search included all study designs. 
Potentially relevant studies identified from bibliographies of manuscripts included in the full text screen were added to the database of studies to screen. 
Individual searches were also performed in Google Scholar as suggested by full text screening no further potentially relevant studies were identified for screening. 


Two investigators (JAH and OB) screened all titles and abstracts independently. Any title or abstract identified as potentially relevant by either investigator was included for full-text review.
