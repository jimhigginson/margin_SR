\subsection{Study Selection}

The electronic literature searches and careful bibliographic examination identified a total of (X) citations for initial screening.
The PRISMA diagram is shown here (this is where I link to it).
Following removal of duplicate citations, (X) unique citations remained.
(X) of these were excluded based on the title and abstract.
Of the remaining (X) studies that underwent full text screening, (X) were excluded.
Papers were excluded if (list reasons here.)

A total of (X) papers fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were included for systematic review and meta-analysis.
In (X) papers, diagnostic accuracy data were directly provided. 
In (X) papers, diagnostic accuracy data was calculated from the derived diagnostic metrics provided.

Include the numbers of studies in each overall category here.
Quality assessment outcomes using the QUADAS-2 and SORT systems are shown in table X.
