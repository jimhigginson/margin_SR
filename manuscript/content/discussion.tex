Hutan made a compelling argument that the whole paper, but especially the discussion, should be compelling and exciting for clinicians in general and surgeons in particular if we are to get it published in a strong journal.

\subsection{Summary of findings}

This study has performed a systematic reviem and meta-analysis of the diagnostic accuracy of established andemerging intraoperative margin assessment techniques.
The results we provide act as a benchmark for comparison with emerging techniques.
The rising incidence of HNSCC, driven by HPV, and the clear desire from patient preference data to avoid recurrence and morbidity associated with adjuvant treatment means that there is a pressing need to develop IMA techniques with satisfactory metrics for widespread adoption into surgical workflow.

Our data suggests that the two best IMA techniques are frozen section (insert sensitivity and specificity here), and chemiluminescent techniques (insert pooled sensitivity and specificity here), with an AUC of ($x$ \& $y$) respectively.
Despite these promising results, neither technique is widely used in current clinical practice
\emph{summary of the reasons for each here before going into detail.}

\subsection{Frozen section}

Frozen section is a long-established adjunct for intra-operative diagnosis and margin evaluation.

It is associated with significant cost, estimated at \$3123 per patient \cite{dinardoAccuracyUtilityCost2000}. 
(This is over \$5200 in today's money (https://www.usinflationcalculator.com))

A key reason for frozen section not being part of routine use is sampling error.

\subsection{Relevance of findings to clinicians, researchers and policy-makers}

The full text screening stage of this systematic review was notable for the high number (check how many) of studies that did not provide raw diagnostic data, or a celar explanation of how diagnostic metrics were calculated, whether per patient, per sample or per test.
this represents a lost opportunity for systhesis of the hard work of colleoagus past \& present into our current understanding of intraoperative diagnsotics.

For this reason, along with previous authors \cite{stjohnDiagnosticAccuracyIntraoperative2017, irwigGuidelinesMetaanalysesEvaluating1994}, we call for all future publications of diagnostic studies in head and neck cancer to be contingent upon provision of raw diagnostic data---ideally in the form of a confusion matrix---and clear reporting of how the index and reference tests were performed.


\subsection{Limitations}

High levels of heterogeneity.
Papers variably reporting per sample or per patient diagnostic accuracy.

In order to meaningfully compare different intraoperative diagnostic modalities, we have elected to group together related but heterogeneous IMA techniques. 
This heterogeneity limits the generalisability of the results.
The 'optical' category is the most heterogeneous, which corresponds to the novelty of this area of research, and the multiple approaches taken by researchers to exploit the differential optical properties of malignant tissue for rapid diagnostics.


\subsection{The role of IMAs}

A question that remains unanswered is whether the use of IMAs to achieve clear margins results in improved oncological outcomes (LOOK DEEPER INTO THIS AND CITE).
The underlying assumption of IMAs is that association between positive surgical margins and poor oncological outcomes is \emph{causative}.
This reasoning assumes that positive margins imply viable malignant cells left \emph{in situ}, with the ability to continue multiplication, local invasion and ultimately acquisition of the mutations necessary to metastasise to distant sites.

Frozen section has been shown in a robust meta-analysis to reduce positive margin rates by 2--3 percentage points \cite{gorpheSystematicReviewMetaanalysis2019}.

However, it is possible that resection with positive margins---where this was not anticipated by the surgeon---reflects a fundamentally aggressive tumour phenotype that is likely to recur whether or not IMAs facilitate resection with clear margins.
There is some evidence to support this theory.
The revision of positive margins to negative guided by frozen section is a major risk factor for local recurrence \cite{PositiveFrozenSection2016}, and where multiple resections are required to achieve clear margins, disease-free and overall-survival is significantly worse \cite{mooreTransoralRoboticSurgery2018}
14 to 22\% of patients may have a positive margin in the final specimen despite a negative intraoperative frozen section result \cite{ordAccuracyFrozenSections1997, RefiningUtilityRole2016}, probably representing sampling error.
