%methods
This systematic review and meta-analysis was performed in accordance with PRISMA guidelines.
A broad literature search was performed, followed by progressive screening of all identified results by two authors.
Studies were included if they provided diagnostic accuracy data regarding an intraoperative diagnostic technique, compared with the reference standard of definitive histopathology.
Data were extracted using Covidence, a dedicated systematic review database.
Raw diagnostic data were extracted or reconstructed from the papers included in the study.
Meta-analysis was performed using the bivariate model to construct summary receiver operator characteristic curves.
The quality and risk of bias was assessed for each study using both QUADAS-2 and SORT scores.

%results

35 studies were eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis.
Frozen section and chemiluminescence appeared to have the best diagnostic performance, with diagnostic odds ratios of (X \& Y; 95\% CI X1-X2, Y1-Y2) respectively, and area under the summary roc curve of (A \& B) respectively.
There was substantial methodological heterogeneity, and the Higgins $I^2$ was (X) for all studies.
There was a relatively low level of publication bias detected by the Trim-Fill method ($K_0 = 3$).
