N2  - BACKGROUND: In head and neck cancers, tumor margin assessment has important prognostic and therapeutic implications. Frozen section control of margins is commonly employed intraoperatively. However, this is not without limitations. The aim of this study is to determine whether intraoperative slicing of the whole specimen is feasible and what impact this may have on tumor margin assessment and the requirement for postoperative radiotherapy., METHODS: From September 2016 to August 2018, we recruited 22 patients as a pilot study looking at both the practicalities and the clinical relevance of whole margin tumor analysis intraoperatively. Our project is a prospective single arm study with historical controls., RESULTS: Forty-one percent of our patients required further intraoperative resection for close or involved margins. Seven of these patients who otherwise would have required adjuvant radiotherapy due to their margin status did not, after our intervention., CONCLUSIONS: We found that although requiring resources, this process was feasible without unduly increasing operative times and with potential patient benefit including reduced incidence of adjuvant radiotherapy.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Computer assisted head and neck reconstruction has gained popularity over the past few years. In computer assisted surgery (CAS), surgical margins are predetermined in virtual surgery and resection guides are designed to be fitted intra-operatively. However, concerns have been raised regarding the oncological safety of predetermined surgical margins. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare surgical margins, recurrence and survival outcomes in patients underwent CAS and non-CAS in head and neck reconstruction., METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the patients underwent oral and maxillofacial malignancies surgical excision and free flap reconstruction from October 2014 to December 2019 by the same chief surgeon. Patients were divided into two groups depending on whether CAS and predetermined surgical margins were adopted. The primary outcome was surgical resection margin and the secondary outcomes included recurrence and survival., RESULTS: A total of 66 subjects were recruited with 37 in the CAS group and 29 in the non-CAS group. The follow-up rate was 100%. The average follow-up time was 24.5 months. No significant difference in resection margin was identified between the groups (p = 0.387). Tumor staging, margin status, perineural invasion, lymphovascular invasion and extranodal extension were identified as significant factors influencing survival. Both before and after adjustment for these prognostic factors identified, CAS and non-CAS group showed no significant difference in survival outcome., CONCLUSION: Predetermined surgical margins do not compromise oncological safety in terms of resection margin, disease recurrence and patient survival.

N2  - Complete tumor extirpation with clear surgical margins remains a central tenet of oncologic head and neck surgery. Rates of locoregional recurrence and survival are both significantly worse when clear margins are unable to be obtained. Current clinical practice relies on the use of frozen sections intra-operatively, followed by traditional histopathologic analysis post-operatively to assess the surgical margin. However, with improved understanding of tumor biology and advances in technology, new techniques have emerged to analyze margins at a molecular level. Such molecular margin analysis interrogates tissue for genetic, epigenetic, or proteomic changes that may belie tumor presence or aggressive features not captured by standard histopathologic techniques. Intra-operatively, this information may be used to guide resection, while post-operatively, it may help to stratify patients for adjuvant treatment. In this review, we summarize the current state of molecular margin analysis and describe directions for future research. Copyright © 2020. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - BACKGROUND: PERP (p53 apoptosis effector related to PMP22) localizes to desmosomes and suppresses squamous cell carcinoma development. Loss of PERP leads to worse local control in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), likely by destabilizing desmosomes. We evaluated PERP loss at HNSCC surgical margins as a predictor of local relapse., METHODS: Combining discovery (n = 17) and validation (n = 31) cohorts, we examined membranous PERP protein expression by immunohistochemistry in surgical mucosal margins with competing risk analysis of the relationship between local relapse and PERP expression., RESULTS: Of the 44 analyzable patients, the 2-year cumulative incidence of local relapse was 44.4% for the PERP-negative group and 16.4% for the PERP-positive group (P = .01). A trend toward worse progression-free survival (P = .09) and overall survival (P = .06) was observed with loss of PERP., CONCLUSIONS: PERP loss at surgical margins is associated with higher risk of local recurrence in HNSCC, warranting further evaluation in a larger prospective study.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Intraoperative evaluation of lymph nodal metastasis in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) assumes importance and avoids over-treatment in clinically node negative (N0) neck. Frozen section (FZ) is the commonly employed technique, but it requires significant investment in resources, time, and personnel. Intraoperative imprint cytology (IC) is a rapid, reliable, and inexpensive alternative. We conducted a prospective study to assess the diagnostic accuracy of intraoperative IC and FZ for lymph node metastasis in HNSCC., METHODS: All patients presenting with HNSCC with clinically N0 neck undergoing surgery were included in the study, and intraoperative assessment of clinically suspicious nodes was done using IC and FZ and was reviewed by two independent pathologists. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of IC and FZ were calculated with reference to the final histopathology report. The time duration for reporting was calculated., RESULTS: Thirty-four patients with clinically N0 neck were included in the study, and 85 slides were examined. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of FZ were 100%, 98.6%, and 98.9%, respectively, whereas for IC, it was 85.7%, 95.8%, and 94.1%, respectively. The mean time duration for reporting for FZ and IC was 41.18 +/- 3.62 and 18.12 +/- 2.01 minutes, respectively., CONCLUSION: IC provides a cheaper, accurate, and rapid alternative for FZ for intraoperative assessment of neck nodes in HNSCC, and it assumes importance in resource-driven countries like India.

N2  - This study aims to assess the feasibility of using indocyanine green and robotic near infra-red fluorescent imaging (Firefly R) for sentinel lymph node biopsy in cN0 oral cavity cancer. Ten patients with early squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue (n = 8) and buccal mucosa (n = 2) were included. Peritumoral injection of 10 mg indocyanine green and real-time mapping of sentinel lymph nodes in the neck was performed using Firefly R via a retro-auricular trans-hairline incision. Sentinel lymph node was detected in all patients at 1.2 sentinel lymph node per person. Majority were situated in level II (91.7%). Mean time to detection of sentinel lymph node was 171.0 (68.0-312.0)s. Mean signal-to-background ratio was 5.62 (3.51-7.91). Frozen section of one sentinel lymph node was positive for malignancy, paraffin section of which confirmed the presence of metastatic disease. Modified radical neck dissection was performed for that particular patient, paraffin section of which did not show any tumor deposit. Frozen section and paraffin section of all other sentinel lymph nodes (n = 11) and neck dissection specimens yielded no malignancy. All resection margins were clear. Three patients completed adjuvant radiotherapy for pT2N0 (n = 2) and pT2N1 (n = 1) carcinoma of the tongue. Mean follow-up was 12.0 (4.0-18.0) months. All patients were alive at last follow-up with no disease recurrence. There were no adverse outcomes associated with the use of indocyanine green and robot-assisted neck dissection. Indocyanine green and Firefly R for sentinel lymph node biopsy in cN0 oral cavity cancer is feasible with no adverse effects.

N2  - Introduction: Carbon dioxide (CO2) laser surgery as a conservative tool plays a peculiar role in the management of head and neck cancer. Numerous patients who were candidates for transoral laryngeal microsurgery have forced us to eliminate frozen-section evaluation of surgical margins and use a magnified view of the larynx. The present study evaluated surgeon-judged negative margins with permanent microscopic pathologic evaluation., Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional study, we evaluated the permanent pathologic margins of the resected laryngeal specimen which were considered negative by judgment of surgeons. Patients consisted of 61 pathologic proven T1-T2 laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cases. In all patients, tumor resection was performed via a transoral route with CO2 laser, and no residual laryngeal tumor was observed according to judgment of the surgeon. The patients with positive margin (s) underwent another resection. Patients were followed up for 18 months for tumor recurrence., Results: The obtained results demonstrated that pathologic margins were reported in 6 patients, with the deep margin being the most common positive margin. During the 18-month follow-up, 8 cases of recurrence were detected., Conclusion: Judgment of the surgeon was in agreement with permanent pathologic evaluation in transoral laryngeal laser resection at the early stages of laryngeal SCC in most cases. Nevertheless, it is suggested that further direct studies be conducted to evaluate the frozen section on oncologic outcomes in transoral laser surgery for laryngeal cancer.

N2  - Objective: Complete surgical resection is the standard of care for treatment of oral cancer although the positive margin rate remains 15-30%. Tissue sampling from the resected specimen and from the wound bed for frozen section analysis (FSA) remains the mainstay for intraoperative margin assessment but is subject to sampling error and can require the processing of multiple samples. We sought to understand if an ex vivo imaging strategy using a tumor-targeted fluorescently labeled antibody could accurately identify the closest peripheral margin on the mucosal surface of resected tumor specimen, so that this "sentinel margin" could be used to guide pathological sampling. Materials and Methods: Twenty-nine patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma scheduled for surgical resection were consented for the study and received systemic administration of a tumor-targeted fluorescently labeled antibody (Panitumumab IRDye800CW). After surgical resection, the tumor specimen was imaged using a closed-field fluorescent imaging device. Relevant pathological data was available for five patients on retrospective review. For each of these five patients, two regions of highest fluorescence intensity at the peripheral margin and one region of lowest fluorescence intensity were identified, and results were correlated with histology to determine if the region of highest fluorescence intensity along the mucosal margin (i.e., the sentinel margin) was truly the closest margin. Results: Imaging acquisition of the mucosal surface of the specimen immediately after surgery took 30 s. In all of the specimens, the region of highest fluorescence at the specimen edge had a significantly smaller margin distance than other sampled regions. The average margin distance at the closest, "sentinel," margin was 3.2 mm compared to a margin distance of 8.0 mm at other regions (p < 0.0001). Conclusions: This proof-of-concept study suggests that, when combined with routine FSA, ex vivo fluorescent specimen imaging can be used to identify the closest surgical margin on the specimen. This approach may reduce sampling error of intraoperative evaluation, which should ultimately improve the ability of the surgeon to identify the sentinel margin. This rapid sentinel margin identification improves the surgeon's orientation to areas most likely to be positive in the surgical wound bed and may expedite pathology workflow.

N2  - Oral cavity cancer is a type of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and contributes to significant morbidity and mortality each year. An epigenetic pathway of transcriptional inactivation for many genes has been described in various cancers, including HNSCC. For our study, we selected genes for which silencing caused by hypermethylation can promote cancer development. In 75 primary HNSCC tumours and paired surgical margins, we investigated the methylation status of the p16, APC, MGMT, TIMP3 and CDH1 gene promoters by methylation-specific PCR after bisulphite treatment. The promoter methylation rates of p16, APC, MGMT, TIMP3 and CDH1 in tumours were 58.67%, 49.33%, 58.67%, 50.67%, and 57.33% and 50.67%, 41.33%, 37.33%, 42.67%, and 25.33% in the surgical margin, respectively. Our observations confirm the presence of epigenetic changes not only in the cancer cells, but also in the surrounding mucosa and represent a basis for further analysis to unravel these complicated issues. Appropriate cancer risk assessment based on epigenetic alterations in surgical margins may influence a patient's diagnosis and cure.

N2  - Worldwide, about 600,000 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) are detected annually, many of which involve high risk human papilloma virus (HPV). Surgery is the primary and desired first treatment option. Following surgery, the existence of cancer cells at the surgical margin is strongly associated with eventual recurrence of cancer and a poor outcome. Despite improved surgical methods (robotics, microsurgery, endoscopic/laparoscopic, and external imaging), surgeons rely only on their vision and touch to locate tumors during surgery. Diagnostic imaging systems like computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron-emission tomography (PET) are too large, slow and costly to use efficiently during most surgeries and, ultrasound imaging, while fast and portable, is not cancer specific. This purpose of this article is to review the fundamental technologies that will radically advance Precision Otolaryngology practices to the benefit of patients with HNSCC. In particular, this article will address the potential for tumor-targeting peptides to enable more precise diagnostic imaging while simultaneously advancing new therapeutic paradigms for next generation image-guided surgery, tumor-specific chemotherapeutic delivery and tumor-selective targeted radiotherapy (i.e., theranostic).

N2  - BACKGROUND: Whole slide imaging (WSI) using high-resolution scanners is gaining acceptance as a platform for consultation as well as for frozen section (FS) evaluation in surgical pathology. We report results of an intra-observer concordance study comparing evaluation of WSI of scanned FS microscope slides with the original interpretation of the same microscope slides after an average lag time of approximately 1-year., METHODS: A total of 70 FS cases (148 microscope slides) originally interpreted by 2 pathologists were scanned at x20 using Aperio CS2 scanner (Leica Biosystems, San Diego, CA, USA). Reports were redacted such that the study pathologists reviewed images using eSlide Manager Healthcare Network application (Leica Biosystems) accompanied by the same clinical information available at the time of original FS evaluation. Discrepancies between the original FS diagnosis and WSI diagnosis were categorized as major (impacted patient care) or minor (no impact on patient care)., RESULTS: Lymph nodes, margins for head and neck cancer resections, and arthroplasty specimens to exclude infection, were the most common FS specimens. The average wash-out interval was 380 days (range: 303-466 days). There was one major discrepancy (1.4% of 70 cases) where the original FS was interpreted as severe squamous dysplasia, and the WSI FS diagnosis was mild dysplasia. There were two minor discrepancies; one where the original FS was called focal moderate squamous dysplasia and WSI FS diagnosis was negative for dysplasia. The second case was an endometrial adenocarcinoma that was originally interpreted as Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) Grade I, while the WSI FS diagnosis was FIGO Grade II., CONCLUSIONS: These findings validate and support the use of WSI to provide interpretation of FS in our network of affiliated hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers.

N2  - The determination of tumor margins during surgical resection remains a challenging task. A complete removal of malignant tissue and conservation of healthy tissue is important for the preservation of organ function, patient satisfaction, and quality of life. Visual inspection and palpation is not sufficient for discriminating between malignant and normal tissue types. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) technology has the potential to noninvasively delineate surgical tumor margin and can be used as an intra-operative visual aid tool. Since histological images provide the ground truth of cancer margins, it is necessary to warp the cancer regions in ex vivo histological images back to in vivo hyperspectral images in order to validate the tumor margins detected by HSI and to optimize the imaging parameters. In this paper, principal component analysis (PCA) is utilized to extract the principle component bands of the HSI images, which is then used to register HSI images with the corresponding histological image. Affine registration is chosen to model the global transformation. A B-spline free form deformation (FFD) method is used to model the local non-rigid deformation. Registration experiment was performed on animal hyperspectral and histological images. Experimental results from animals demonstrated the feasibility of the hyperspectral imaging method for cancer margin detection.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The annual mortality rate from head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is over 11,000 worldwide. Squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) frequently metastasizes to the regional lymph nodes which are the first site of arrest of tumor cells that have invaded the peritumoral lymphatics, hence the strongest predictor of disease prognosis and outcome., AIM: The present study aims to compare the efficacy of frozen sections (cryosection), step-serial sectioning conventional H and E staining, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and RT-PCR analysis in detection of lymph node micrometastasis., MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective series of 30 patients who were diagnosed with primary squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity and underwent surgical treatment including unilateral or bilateral selective neck dissection were considered for the study., RESULT: Metastatic carcinomatous cells were observed in H and E staining of frozen section in 18 lymph nodes (54%) and in 19 lymph nodes (57%) in step-serial sectioned H and E-stained sections of the 78 lymph nodes from 30 patients. Carcinomatous cells were immunolabeled with pancytokeratin in 18 lymphnodes (54%). CK19 mRNA was detected in 33 lymph nodes of 16 patients. RT-PCR gave positive signals for 24% and 23% of lymph nodes positive by histopathology and immunohistochemistry., CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that RT-PCR is far more sensitive in detection of micrometastasis than any other technique used in routine procedures and immunohistochemistry. Fifty-three percent patients with micrometastasis detected by RT-PCR had large T3/T4 tumors. Prognosis was poor for patients who were positive for micrometastasis detected only by RT-PCR, among which two patients died within a period of 6 months.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of close or positive surgical margins on the outcome, and to determine whether margin status influence the recurrence rate and the overall survival for patients with head and neck cancers., METHODS: Records from 1996 to 2001 of 413 patients with primary head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) treated with surgery as the first line treatment were analysed. Of these patients, 82 were eligible for the study. Patients were followed up for 5 years., RESULTS: Patients with margins between 5-10 mm had 50% recurrence rate (RR), those with surgical margins between 1-5 mm had RR of 59% and those with positive surgical margins had RR of 90% (P=0.004). The 5-year survival rates were 54%, 39% and 10%, respectively (P=0.002)., CONCLUSIONS: Unsatisfactory surgical margin is an independent risk factor for recurrence free survival as well as overall survival regardless of the other tumor and patient characteristics.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Mixed results exist as to whether positive surgical margins impact survival. The aim of this study was to determine whether positive surgical margins are indeed associated with decreased survival in patients with primary head and neck cancer., METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 261 cases diagnosed with cancer of the larynx or tongue between 1995 and 1999. Cases were followed through December 31, 2002. Survival curves by margin status were generated by Kaplan-Meier methods. Categorical data were evaluated with odds ratios (OR)., RESULTS: All-cause mortality was markedly higher in cases with positive margins as compared with those with negative margins (54% versus 29%, P = 0.005). This pattern also appeared after adjusting for age and sex (OR = 2.97, 95% CI: 1.29-6.84)., CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that positive surgical margin status is associated with increased mortality. This association also generally persists after adjustment for tumor size, stage, and adjuvant therapy.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Imaging provides crucial staging information for treatment planning of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs). Despite technical progress in imaging techniques, defining the extent of bone involvement preoperatively remains challenging and requires intraoperative information to control for adequate resection. The intraoperative cytological assessment of the bone resection margins (ICAB) provides information whether bone is infiltrated by carcinoma. The aim of this study was to assess the diagnostic value of preoperative imaging compared with ICAB in order to achieve carcinoma-free bone margins., MATERIALS AND METHODS: 108 HNSCC patients underwent preoperative computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and orthopantomogram (OPG) for staging and surgical planning. Curative resection was planned based on imaging. Intraoperatively, the resection margins were controlled by ICAB. The diagnostic value of preoperative imaging and ICAB was assessed with reference to the histological findings., RESULTS: CT showed a sensitivity of 89.7%, specificity of 63.0%, positive predictive value (PPV) of 85.9%, and negative predictive value (NPV) of 70.8%. MRI revealed a sensitivity of 45.5%, specificity of 66.7%, PPV of 71.4% and NPV of 40.0%. OPG-imaging had a sensitivity of 64.7%, specificity of 76.2%, PPV of 81.5%, NPV 57.1%. In comparison, ICAB provided a sensitivity of 78.6%, specificity of 95.7%, PPV 73.3%, and NPV 96.7%. The accuracy was 82.1%, 52.9%, 69.0%, and 93.5% for CT, MRI, OPG, and ICAB, respectively., CONCLUSION: Preoperative imaging lacks accuracy in defining adequate bone resection margins, compared with ICAB. ICAB supports preoperative imaging and intraoperative frozen sections to improve bone margin control. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Failure to achieve tumor-free margins is the single largest cause of death for head neck cancer patients. At the same time, it is the only factor that is in complete control of the surgeon. This review summarizes evidence for the definition, clinical implications, and methods to achieve optimal margins., RECENT FINDINGS: The previous universally followed definition of adequate margin (5 mm in final histopathology) has been disputed. Various biological, optical, and imaging adjuncts can aid in achieving optimal margins. Extent of resection and margins in human papilloma virus (HPV)-positive oropharyngeal cancers and following induction chemotherapy remain controversial. Though practiced widely, frozen section-guided margin revision has not conclusively shown improved local control rates. The role of molecular assessment of margins is promising but not established. The definition of adequate margin differs according to the site in the head neck region. Currently, the 5-mm margin at final histopathology is the most commonly accepted definition of an "adequate" margin.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Despite the rapid growth of fluorescence imaging, accurate sampling of tissue sections remains challenging. Development of novel technologies to improve intraoperative assessment of tissue is needed., METHODS: A novel contact probe-based fluorescence dosimeter device, optimized for IRDye800CW quantification, was developed. After evaluation of the device in a phantom setup, its clinical value was defined ex vivo in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma who received panitumumab-IRDye800CW., RESULTS: Ten patients were enrolled with a total of 216 data points obtained. Final histopathology showed tumor in 119 spots and normal tissue in 97 spots. Fluorescence-to-excitation ratios in tumor tissue were more than three times higher than those in normal tissue. The area under the curve was 0.86 (95% CI: 0.81-0.91) for tumor detection., CONCLUSIONS: Fluorescence-guided tissue preselection using a fluorescence dosimeter could have substantial impact on tissue sampling for frozen section analysis and potentially reduce sampling errors.

N2  - Incomplete surgical resection of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the most common cause of local HNSCC recurrence. Currently, surgeons rely on preoperative imaging, direct visualization, palpation and frozen section to determine the extent of tissue resection. It has been demonstrated that optical coherence tomography (OCT), a minimally invasive, nonionizing near infrared mesoscopic imaging modality can resolve subsurface differences between normal and abnormal head and neck mucosa. Previous work has utilized two-dimensional OCT imaging which is limited to the evaluation of small regions of interest generated frame by frame. OCT technology is capable of performing rapid volumetric imaging, but the capacity and expertise to analyze this massive amount of image data is lacking. In this study, we evaluate the ability of a retrained convolutional neural network to classify three-dimensional OCT images of head and neck mucosa to differentiate normal and abnormal tissues with sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 70%, respectively. This method has the potential to serve as a real-time analytic tool in the assessment of surgical margins. Copyright © 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

N2  - BACKGROUND: To report our institutional experience with intraoperative radiotherapy for persistent or recurrent head and neck cancer., METHODS: Sixty-one patients were treated with salvage surgery and intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT). Fifty-eight patients (95%) had previously received external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) as a component of their definitive therapy. Forty-four patients (72%) had squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Surgical margins were positive in 28 patients (46%). IORT was prescribed to a median dose of 12.5 Gy (range, 10-17.5). Twenty-three patients (38%) received a course of postoperative EBRT (median 45 Gy). Clinical outcomes were retrospectively reviewed and univariate analysis was performed using log-rank tests to correlate clinical outcomes with histology, surgical margin, and adjuvant therapy., RESULTS: Median follow-up among surviving patients was 15.9 months. Median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 9.8 and 19.1 months, respectively. One- and 2-year rates of locoregional control (LRC) were 59% and 35%, respectively. One- and 2-year rates of PFS were 39% and 19%, respectively. One- and 2-year rates of OS were 62% and 42%, respectively. Overall survival was better for non-SCC histology (P = .03). For SCC patients, negative surgical margin showed a trend toward improved PFS (P = .09) and OS (P = .06). There was one grade-5 toxicity due to carotid rupture., CONCLUSIONS: IORT has shown effective LRC and OS with an acceptably low rate of severe toxicity at our institution. OS was significantly better for non-SCC histology. For SCC patients, there is a trend toward improved PFS and OS associated with negative surgical margins. Copyright © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Transoral surgery (TOS) has been widely applied for early T-stage head and neck cancer (HNC). The resection is performed with a minimum safety margin for function preservation under a limited surgical field; therefore, it is difficult to have a strong conviction about the complete resection. This study aims to evaluate the completeness of the initial TOS procedure; possibility of primary control by TOS alone; and predictive factors in patients with early T-stage laryngeal, oropharyngeal, and hypopharyngeal cancer., METHODS: Patients were treated by TOS at the primary site with or without neck dissection. The patients were divided into two groups based on the pathological evaluation of their surgical specimens: the control (observation) group, in that the resection was considered complete and the intervention (second-look procedure) group, in that incomplete tumor resection was suspected. The predictive factors for the possibility and/or limitations of complete resection by TOS were then analyzed., RESULTS: The study enrolled 26 and 25 patients in the control and intervention group, respectively. The success rate for single resection was 66% and the predictive factor was tumor depth obtained by enhanced computed tomography (CT) examination (odds ratio, 7.870, P = .0243). The success rate for definitive therapy by TOS alone was 83% and the predictive factor was poor differentiation observed on pathological examination (odds ratio, 6.800, P = .0248)., CONCLUSIONS: TOS has the potential for both definitive resection and function preservation with minimal invasiveness. Identification of the risk factors for TOS is advantageous for accurate treatment selection in patients with early T-stage HNC. Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Determine rate of preoperative biopsy in parotid malignancies, identify factors associated with its use, and its association with surgical margins., STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort., SETTING: Commission on Cancer-Accredited Institutions., SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We included 5533 patients treated surgically for a parotid malignancy 2004-2014 in the National Cancer Database. Chi-squared tests, univariable, and multivariable logistic regressions were used to evaluate predictors of preoperative biopsy (defined as needle, aspiration, or incisional), and associate biopsy with surgical margins., RESULTS: Preoperative biopsy was utilized in 26.0% of patients. Biopsy was more likely in patients >60 years (odds ratio [OR]: 1.19, P = .035), advanced clinical T stage (vs. T1,T2 OR: 1.23, P = .009; T3 OR: 1.26, P = .026; T4A OR: 2.05, P < .001), advanced clinical N stage (vs. N0, N1: OR: 1.39, P = .013; N2/3: OR: 1.63, P < .001), in academic centers (OR: 1.18, P < .024), and in higher volume centers (vs. low, medium OR: 1.28, P = .002; high OR: 2.16, P < .001). Biopsy use increased over time (vs. 2004-2006, 2007-2010 OR: 1.20, P = .047; 2011-2014 OR: 1.39, P < .001). Biopsy was associated with a reduced risk of positive margins in patients with clinical T1 stage (OR: 0.70, P = .012), and younger than 61 (OR: 0.79, P = .036)., CONCLUSION: The national rate of preoperative biopsy in parotid malignancy is low at 26.0%, but has increased over time. Preoperative biopsy is associated with a reduced risk of positive margins in younger patients and those with early clinical stage, suggesting its increased use may improve surgical outcomes and decrease reoperation or adjuvant therapy in these subgroups of patients., LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3 Laryngoscope, 130:1450-1458, 2020.

N2  - PURPOSE: Despite major advancements in surgical oncology, the positive margin rate for primary head and neck cancer resection remains around 15%-30%. In particular, the deep surface margin is the most challenging to adequately assess. Inadequate margins are directly correlated to poor survival, and as such, mitigation of these rates is critical to improve patient outcomes. We have developed an ex vivo imaging strategy that utilizes fluorescence intensity peaks (relative to background signal) of an injected anti-EGFR antibody conjugated to a fluorescent probe to locate potential close or positive margins on the deep surface of the resected tumor specimen., EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Twelve patients with head and neck cancer scheduled for surgery received systemic administration of a tumor-specific contrast-agent (panitumumab-IRDye800CW). After surgical resection, the tumor specimen was imaged using a fluorescence imager. The three highest fluorescence intensity-peaks on the deep surface of the specimen were isolated and correlated to histology to determine the margin distance at these regions., RESULTS: Relative fluorescence peak intensities identified the closest margin on the deep surface of the specimen within 2.5 minutes. The highest intensity peak consistently (100%) detected the closest margin to the tumor. The difference in tumor margin distance between the first and second highest fluorescence intensity peak averaged 2.1 +/- 1.4 mm. The tumor-margin difference between the second and third highest peak averaged 1.6 +/- 0.6 mm., CONCLUSIONS: Fluorescence intensity peaks can identify the region on the specimen where tumor is closest to specimen's edge on the deep surface. This technique could have broad applications in obtaining adequate margins in oncological surgery. Copyright ©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.

N2  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Surgical management of locally advanced oral cavity squamous cell carcinomas (OCSCC) has long been recognized as a primary treatment modality. Technological advances have led to significant improvements in our surgical approach, from improvement in the visualization of tumors to more efficient and precise reconstruction. Here, we review the latest technological advances in surgical extirpation and reconstruction of locally advanced OCSCCs., RECENT FINDINGS: The focus of technological innovation in surgical extirpation has been on improving visualization, with the use of intraoperative ultrasound for margin delineation, intraoperative navigation, narrow-band imaging, and the use of fluorescence. Though early, these are promising steps to ensuring complete resection of the cancer. Advances in reconstruction have been centered on the incorporation of computer assisted design, manufacturing, and virtual surgical planning, allowing for more complex three-dimensional defects to be expeditiously reconstructed. As these technologies are still under development, their impact on oncologic outcomes are not yet robustly defined; however, as technology continues to advance and become more widely available, new technologies will undoubtedly become integrated into enhancing surgical precision and planning.

N2  - A clear bone margin is essential for complete resection of the bone-involved tumour, but the evaluation of hard tissue takes time and is impractical intraoperatively. Bone marrow assessment remains controversial. The aim of this study was to investigate the diagnostic value of intraoperative bone marrow assessment for bone margins. PubMed and Web of Science were searched for studies published between 1990 and 2017. A systematic review was conducted. After quality assessment, 10 articles with 11 cohorts and 404 patients were identified. Sensitivity, specificity, and other measures were pooled for meta-analysis; the estimates for intraoperative bone marrow assessment were as follows: sensitivity 0.82 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62-0.93), specificity 0.99 (95% CI 0.96-1.00), positive likelihood ratio 109.79 (95% CI 22.99-524.34), negative likelihood ratio 0.18 (95% CI 0.08-0.42), and diagnostic odds ratio 241.82 (95% CI 90.33-647.38). Furthermore, sensitivity and specificity at the summary operating point of the summary receiver operating characteristic curve were 0.82 and 0.99, respectively, and the area under the curve was 0.99. Intraoperative bone marrow assessment was investigated by meta-analysis and shown to have a high level of overall accuracy for the diagnosis of bone margins. Copyright © 2020.

N2  - OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To evaluate the usefulness of fused positron emission tomography (PET)/magnetic resonance (MR) images for surgical planning in patients with oral/oropharyngeal cancer and suspected mandibular invasion., STUDY DESIGN: Individual cohort study., METHODS: Eleven of 17 patients with suspected mandibular invasion of squamous cell carcinoma of the lower gingiva, oropharynx, and buccal mucosa who underwent 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/computed tomography (CT) and contrast-enhanced MR imaging (MRI) and had fused PET/MR images were enrolled in this study. The area for surgical resection was determined based on the fused images. The usefulness of these images was confirmed by comparing them with the histopathologic findings in the resected tumors., RESULTS: Histopathologic evaluation of the surgical specimens revealed that nine of the 11 patients had invasion into the mandible and/or medial pterygoid muscle. All patients had a negative surgical margin. The sensitivity and specificity for detection of mandibular/medial pterygoid muscle invasion was 100%/40% and 83%/100% by fused PET/MRI, respectively, and 100%/20% and 100%/60% by PET/CT, respectively. Interobserver reproducibility between two radiologists/nuclear medicine physicians and two head and neck surgeons showed that the only statistically significant kappa values were for PET/MRI., CONCLUSIONS: PET/MRI can be easily understood by head and neck surgeons, who are not diagnostic imaging professionals, and can be used when planning the area to be surgically resected in patients with oral/oropharyngeal cancer and clinically suspected mandibular invasion. Considering the expense of a hybrid PET/MRI system, creation of a fused PET/MR image would provide a reasonable and reliable tool for clinical use in these patients., LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 2b Laryngoscope, 130:367-374, 2020.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (neo-CT) for osteosarcomas is the standard of care. Management of maxillo-facial osteosarcomas (MFOS) is challenging. In this rare disease, we collected a large cohort of patients with the aim to report the histological and radiological local response rates to neo-CT., PATIENTS AND METHODS: All consecutive adult patients treated between 2001 and 2016 in two French sarcoma referral centers (Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital, APHP, RESAP France and Gustave Roussy Institute France), for a histologically proved MFOS were included. Clinical, histological and radiological data were independently reviewed. Tumor response to neo-CT was assessed clinically, radiologically with independent review using RECIST v1.1 criterion and pathologically (percentage of necrosis). Multivariate analysis was done for outcomes, tumor response and disease-free survival (DFS)., RESULTS: A total of 35 high grade MFOS were collected. The clinical tumor response was 4% (1/24 receiving neo-CT), the radiological response was 0% (0/18 with available data) and the pathological response was 5% (1/20 with available data). Three patients (12.5%) initially resectable became unresectable due to clinical and radiological progression during neo-CT. Tumor size and R0 (clear margins) surgical resections were significantly associated with DFS., CONCLUSION: MFOS is a rare disease. This large retrospective cohort of MFOS indicates the lack of benefit and potentially deleterious effects of neo-CT. We suggest privileging primary surgery in initially localized resectable MFOS. The benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy should be prospectively studied. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the adverse clinicopathologic features of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), including margin status, depth of invasion, lymphovascular invasion, perineural invasion, and extranodal extension that significantly affect survival outcomes., MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective cross-sectional study included 341 patients with OSCC who underwent therapeutic surgical treatment in Taiwan. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate survival outcomes. A multivariable Cox regression model was used to evaluate the associations of various clinicopathologic features with 5-year overall survival (OS) outcomes in patients with pN0 and pN+ tumors., RESULTS: Overall, the patients had 5-year OS and progression-free survival rates of 60.0 and 47.9%, respectively. In the pN0 group, the multivariate analysis identified a positive margin (odds ratio [OR]=16.3, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 3.7-72.3; P=0.001), depth of invasion >5mm (OR=2.1, 95% CI: 1.2-3.7; P=0.012), presence of lymphovascular space invasion (OR=5.4, 95% CI: 1.3-22.0; P=0.018), and presence of perineural invasion (OR=4.3, 95% CI: 1.7-11.1; P=0.002) as independent and significant prognosticators of OS. In the pN+ group, only the presence of extranodal extension independently predicted OS (OR=1.7, 95% CI: 1.1-2.7; P=0.0026)., CONCLUSIONS: When determining survival prognosis for patients with a pN0 status, we recommended including all adverse features. In contrast, extranodal extension was the most important prognostic factor for patients with a pN+ status. Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.. All rights reserved.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: The impact of positive tumor margin status and other clinicopathological factors on prognosis in early stage glottic squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) treated with transoral laser microsurgery (TLM) remains unclear. This study examined overall survival (OS) rates of patients with positive tumor margin status compared to negative tumor margin status after TLM in clinical T1-2 glottic SCC., MATERIALS AND METHODS: The National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) was queried for patients who underwent resection of T1-2 glottic SCC by TLM. Patients were treated from 2004 to 2013. Overall survival was assessed with Kaplan-Meier curve analysis, and univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis. Differences in clinicopathologic factors between positive and negative margin groups were compared using Pearson Chi-squared analysis., RESULTS: Of 747 patients meeting inclusion criteria, 598 (80.1%) had negative margins. Median follow-up time was 48.0months. Unadjusted 5-year OS for positive margins (80.0%) was lower compared to that of negative tumor margins (82.9%), but this was not statistically significant (P=0.265). This persisted after multivariate analysis (P=0.960). When tumors were stratified by T stage (647T1, 100T2), unadjusted 5-year OS based on margin status remained statistically insignificant for both T1 (P=0.933) and T2 tumors (P=0.350)., CONCLUSION: Positive margins did not negatively impact overall survival among patients with TLM-treated early-stage glottic cancer. This finding might be useful clinically in deciding treatment modality for early stage glottic SCC. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Surgical management of the unknown primary head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (UP HNSCC) remains controversial due to challenging clinical diagnosis. This study compares positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) findings with intraoperative identification of primary tumors and compares intraoperative frozen-section margins to final histopathology. In addition, adjuvant therapy indications are provided., STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort study., SETTING: Academic university hospital., SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Sixty-one patients with UP HNSCC were included. Patients received PET-CT, followed by oropharyngeal transoral laser microsurgery (TLM). Margins were assessed intraoperatively using frozen sections and afterward by final histopathology. Adjuvant treatment was based on final histopathology., RESULTS: The sensitivity of localizing the primary tumor with PET-CT was 50.9% with a specificity of 82.5%. The primary tumor was found intraoperatively on frozen sections in 82% (n = 50) of patients. Five more tumors were identified on final histopathology, leading to a total of 90% (n = 55). Of the 50 intraoperatively found tumors, 98% (n = 49) had negative margins on frozen sections, and 90% (n = 45) were truly negative on final histopathology. Eighteen patients (29.5%) avoided adjuvant treatment., CONCLUSION: PET-CT localized the primary tumor in fewer than half the cases. This protocol identified 90% of primary tumors. Intraoperative frozen-section margin assessment has shown potential with a specificity of 92% compared to final histopathology. As a result, adjuvant therapy was avoided in almost one-third of our patients.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To study the determinants of locoregional control (LRC) on stage I/II oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) classified by AJCC 8th edition., METHODS: Retrospective analysis from 296 patients of pT1-2N0 oral OSCC treated with surgery (wide local excision and selective neck dissection). Those receiving adjuvant therapy were excluded. Multivariate analysis was performed for impact of adverse pathological features (APFs) on LRC., RESULTS: In stage I, LRC was impacted by perineural invasion (PNI) (HR 7.72, p=0.010, 95% CI 1.64-36.26) and moderate/poor differentiation (MD/PD) (HR 3.04, p=0.049, 95% CI 0.99-9.25). In stage II, LRC was impacted by depth of invasion (DOI) (HR 1.59, p=0.014, 95% CI 1.099-2.32), PNI (HR=2.86, p=0.005, 95% CI 1.36-5.98). Combined MD/PD and PNI were associated with worse LRC than either feature individually (HR=4.12, p<0.001, 95% CI 2.16-7.85)., CONCLUSION: PNI and differentiation accurately predict LRC in AJCC 8th edition classified stage I/II OSCC. PNI was a stronger predictor of locoregional failure than DOI in stage II disease. By incorporating these parameters, we can improve precision in staging of early OSCC and identify potential candidates for treatment escalation to improve outcomes.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Concomitant chemoradiation therapy is a standard treatment for head and neck cancer. Thus, salvage surgery has become a necessary treatment. The aim of the study was to evaluate the results of salvage surgery by each site of the head and neck, especially the oropharynx, hypopharynx and larynx., METHODS: This was a retrospective, single-institute study. The primary endpoint was overall survival. Secondary endpoints were disease-free survival, the locoregional control rate after salvage surgery, the indication rate for salvage surgery, the reasons for contraindications to salvage surgery, the post-operative complication rate and the predictors of survival., RESULTS: Three-year overall survival after salvage surgery was 58.8% in the salvage surgery group and 8.59% in the other treatment group (P < 0.0001). Regarding overall survival and disease-free survival after salvage surgery, there was no difference among sites. Regarding locoregional control rate among sites, there was no significant difference. The oropharyngeal cancer group had the lowest rate of salvage primary resection. Surgical margin and local and regional recurrence or residual disease were predictors on univariate and multivariate analyses., CONCLUSIONS: Salvage surgery is effective for recurrent or residual cases after concomitant chemoradiation therapy. For oropharyngeal cancer, local control is important, and for oropharyngeal cancer and hypopharyngeal cancer, distant metastasis is important. Copyright © The Author(s) 2019.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Minor salivary gland carcinomas of the head and neck are rare cancers with variable clinical behavior. This study explored the incidence, pathology, clinical behavior, and factors predictive of outcomes in a large cohort of patients treated at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center over a 30-year period (1985-2015)., METHODS: Clinical, pathological, treatment, and outcome data were collected. Unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios for each variable were calculated with univariate and multivariable Cox regression for survival and recurrence outcomes., RESULTS: Four hundred fifty patients were included: 55% were female, 56% were younger than 60 years, and the median follow-up was 74 months (range, 1-364 months). The most common site was the oral cavity with 305 tumors (68%), which was followed by the oropharynx with 96 (21%), the sinonasal cavity with 38 (8%), the trachea with 7 (2%), and the larynx with 4 (1%). The most common histological types were mucoepidermoid carcinoma (180 tumors [40%]), adenoid cystic carcinoma (141 tumors [31%]), and polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinoma (54 tumors [12%]). The 5-year predicted overall survival rate was 86%, and the disease-specific survival rate was 94% at 5 years. Pathology and tumor stage were significant variables on multivariate analysis for overall survival, disease-specific survival, recurrence-free survival, local recurrence-free survival, regional recurrence-free survival, and distant recurrence-free survival., CONCLUSIONS: American Joint Committee on Cancer stage and pathology were the most predictive variables across all outcomes. Tumor site, postoperative radiotherapy, and margin status were not statistically significant variables after tumor stage and pathology were controlled for in most outcomes.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Achieving complete tumour resection is one of the main goals of surgery for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) tumours. Whether biological characteristics of tumours contribute to the surgical resectability and the presence of positive surgical margins (SM) after resection of HNSCC is unclear. We aimed to address this issue., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to relate the SM status of 356 HNSCC tumours covering five major primary locations (tongue, larynx, tonsils, floor of mouth and buccal mucosa) with data from multiple omics approaches (transcriptomic, genomic and proteomic analyses)., RESULTS: We identified three differentially expressed genes whose expression was significantly associated with the presence of positive SM in tongue tumours (n=144). The three genes (CCDC66, ZRANB2 and VCPKMT) displayed significantly higher mRNA levels in tongue tumours with positive SM compared to tumours with negative SM. The corresponding gene expression signature identified tongue tumours with a positive SM with high sensitivity and specificity (85% and 76%, respectively, Area Under the Curve (AUC)=0.84). Tongue tumours with this signature were characterised by a high grade, elevated proliferation levels and a tumour stroma with fewer fibroblasts and endothelial cells., CONCLUSION: Positive SM were found to be strikingly associated with tumour biology in tongue tumours. These findings offer interesting perspectives for biomarker identification and precision surgery in these tumours. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The infiltrative nature and lymphatic metastasis of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) are the main reasons leading to its poor prognosis., METHODS: A multimodal surface-enhanced resonance Raman spectroscopy (SERRS) and magnetic resonance (MR) nanoprobe, in which paramagnetic chelators and heptamethine cyanine-based Raman reporter molecules were functionalized on a gold nanostar (AuS) surface was developed. Preoperative MRI and intraoperative SERRS-guided surgery were performed on rabbits bearing head and neck VX2 tumours to determine feasibility of the MR/SERRS probe in defining tumour marginal infiltration and lymph nodes metastasis., FINDINGS: Preoperative T1-weighted MRI (T1W-MRI) unambiguously delineated the orthotopic head and neck VX2 tumour xenograft and detected the metastatic lymph nodes in rabbit models after intravenous administration of the probe. With the assistance of a hand-held Raman detector, the probe not only intra-operatively demarcated invasive tumour margins but also successfully distinguished metastatic lymph nodes via a remarkable attenuated Raman signal. Importantly, the group of rabbits subjected to the SERRS-guided surgery exhibited prolonged median survival time (78 days) compared with that of the control group without surgical intervention (29 days) or the group treated with conventional white-light-guided surgery (42 days) (P < 0.0001)., INTERPRETATION: we developed a novel AuS-based multimodal MR/SERRS probe. The capability of this probe to identify both a tumour xenograft and metastatic lymph nodes preoperatively by MRI and intra-operatively by SERRS not only avoids the need for unnecessary resection of neurological structures but also provides a new opportunity to improve the surgical prognosis of head and neck carcinoma of infiltrative nature.

Y1  - 2019//
N2  - Oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas associated with high risk HPV show a wide morphological spectrum, including papillary, adenosquamous, lymphoepithelioma-like and sarcomatoid. We report an interesting case of ciliated HPV-related carcinoma arising from tonsillar tissue in a 55-year-old man which was associated with HPV33. This rare variant has been described in only a handful of cases in the literature, and to our knowledge this is the first case specifically associated with HPV33. The presence of cilia is a potential diagnostic problem as it has been traditionally considered a feature of benignancy, and could pose a particular challenge on frozen section. The diagnostic challenges, differential diagnosis of this tumor and the association with HPV33 are discussed.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To determine predictors of treatment selection, outcome, and survival, we examined a cohort of previously irradiated head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 100 patients at our institution who were treated for recurrent or second primary (RSP) HNSCC, focusing on subgroups receiving reirradiation (ReRT) alone and those undergoing surgical salvage (SS) with or without post-operative reirradiation therapy (POReRT). Logistic regression modeling was performed to identify factors predictive of retreatment modality. Cox regression modeling was used to determine prognostic factors for progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS)., RESULTS: ReRT alone was less likely in current smokers and neck recurrences, with reirradiation more likely in primary site recurrences. POReRT was significantly more likely in patients with positive surgical margins (PSM), neck dissection, or organ dysfunction. POReRT omission negatively impacted PFS when PSM (HR: 8.894, 95% CI: 1.742-45.403) and perineural invasion (PNI) (HR: 3.391, 95% CI: 1.140-10.089) were present. Tracheostomy was associated with worse OS, but ReRT alone and POReRT improved OS. PSM correlated with worse OS, regardless of whether POReRT was given (HR: 14.260, 95% CI: 2.064-98.547)., CONCLUSION: This analysis confirms known factors for predicting outcome and shows nonsmoking status and primary site recurrence as predictors for ReRT alone. POReRT for PSM and PNI improves PFS. Tracheostomy patients are more likely to have ReRT due to acute toxicity not limiting treatment and POReRT improves OS compared to surgery alone. The presence of PSM negatively impacts survival which cannot be overcome by POReRT. Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Surgical resection remains the primary treatment for the majority of solid tumors. Despite efforts to obtain wide margins, close or positive surgical margins (<5mm) are found in 15-30% of head and neck cancer patients. Obtaining negative margins requires immediate, intraoperative feedback of margin status. To this end, we propose optical specimen mapping of resected tumor specimens immediately after removal., MATERIALS AND METHODS: A first-in-human pilot study was performed in patients (n=8) after infusion of fluorescently labeled antibody, panitumumab-IRDye800 to allow surgical mapping of the tumor specimen. Patients underwent standard of care surgical resection for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Optical specimen mapping was performed on the primary tumor specimen and correlated with pathological findings after tissue processing., RESULTS: Optical mapping of the specimen had a 95% sensitivity and 89% specificity to detect cancer within 5mm (n=160) of the cut surface. To detect tumor within 2mm of the specimen surface, the sensitivity of optical specimen mapping was 100%. The maximal observed penetration depth of panitumumab-IRDye800 through human tissue in our study was 6.3mm., CONCLUSION: Optical specimen mapping is a highly sensitive and specific method for evaluation of margins within <5mm of the tumor mass in HNSCC specimens. This technology has potentially broad applications for ensuring adequate tumor resection and negative margins in head and neck cancers. Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Identify positive margin rate in a national cohort of patients with submandibular carcinoma, identify predictors of positive margins, and associate margins with overall survival., STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort., SETTING: Commission on Cancer-accredited hospitals., SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We included patients in the National Cancer Database from 2004 to 2014 who were diagnosed with submandibular carcinoma and underwent primary surgical resection. We determined the rate of positive surgical margins and associated patient, tumor, and treatment factors with positive margins via univariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis. We associated margin status with overall survival by Kaplan-Meier curve and Cox proportional hazards regression., RESULTS: We identified 1150 patients with submandibular malignancy undergoing surgical resection. Positive margin rate was 41.0%. Increased odds of positive margins were seen in patients with advanced T stage (vs T1, T3: odds ratio [OR] = 3.04, P < .001; T4a: OR = 2.89, P < .001), adenoid cystic carcinoma histology (OR = 1.54, P = .020), and those treated at nonacademic facilities (OR = 1.41, P = .008). Patients who underwent a preoperative diagnostic biopsy had decreased odds of positive margins (OR = 0.72, P = .014). Positive margins were associated with reduced overall survival (58% vs 69% 5-year overall survival, P < .001; hazard ratio = 1.49, P = .001) when controlling for patient, tumor, and management factors., CONCLUSIONS: The national positive margin rate of submandibular carcinoma is 41.0%. Preoperative biopsy and treatment at academic institutions independently decreased the risk of positive margins, and positive margins were independently associated with diminished overall survival. Positive margin rate for submandibular carcinoma may be considered a benchmark for quality of care.

N2  - Background: We aimed to reduce the morbidity related to treatment and to preserve organ function in patients with hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (HPSCC) by applying a new surgical treatment protocol based on transoral robotic surgery (TORS). Aims/objectives: In this study, we analyzed the prognostic factors related to survival to confirm the validity and effectiveness of TORS in patients with advanced-stage HPSCC. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the data of 44 HPSCC patients who had undergone TORS-based therapy. Results: In univariate analysis, only the surgical marginal status showed a statistically significant correlation with the survival of the patients (p = .009). In multivariate analysis, surgical margin status was the only statistically significant prognostic factor related to survival (p = .008). Forty-one patients (93.2%) recovered speech function sufficiently to perform daily conversation without artificial aids. Forty-one patients (93.2%) were able to ingest food orally. Conclusions: In the treatment of advanced hypopharyngeal cancer, TORS-based therapy helped the surgeon obtain a clear surgical margin in patients with HPSCC, and it showed superior oncologic and functional outcomes compared to the existing treatment methods.

N2  - Pharyngocutaneous fistula after laryngectomy is common and significantly increases the morbidity of the procedure. Intraoperative, objective variables that can reliably predict fistula formation would be useful to surgeons deciding how to reconstruct the laryngectomy defect. Retrospective chart review of 50 radiated patients and 10 non-radiated patients who underwent total laryngectomy at a single tertiary care institution. Patients with pharyngocutaneous fistula were selected to ensure a representative sample were available for comparison. All patients had pathology slides available for re-review by a single, blinded pathologist. Margins of both radiated (n = 50) and non-radiated (n = 10) larynges were examined for 7 histologic features, and odds ratios were calculated to assess whether these features were associated with fistula. When evaluating all 60 patients, both telangiectatic capillaries and hyalinized arterioles were associated with fistula (OR 3.72 and 9.21, respectively). Collinearity between the variables was evaluated; findings indicated a high likelihood of having hyalinized arterioles if telangiectatic capillaries were also present (OR 31.67 [3.13, 320.06]). Microvascular changes in radiated tissue have previously been described in other anatomic subsites, but the larynx and pharynx have not been specifically evaluated. Laryngectomy mucosal margins appear to display similar changes, and evidence of this damage may be associated with fistula formation. These features could potentially guide the surgeon to alter the reconstructive technique.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to clarify the impact of superficial parotidectomy and postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) for the surgical treatment of early stage squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in external auditory canal (EAC)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-seven patients with T1 (n = 14) or T2 (n = 19) SCC in EAC treated between 2000 and 2016 at Kobe University Hospital were enrolled in this study. Thirty-three patients were operated with sleeve resection or lateral temporal bone resection., RESULTS: The 5-year overall survival and disease-specific survival rates were 95% and 100%, respectively. Surgical margin was positive in 4 patients, who were treated by PORT and have been alive without disease. Prophylactic superficial parotidectomy was simultaneously performed at the time of initial surgery in 15 patients, in whom no lymph node (LN) metastasis was observed. Among the other 22 patients, regional recurrence in parotid LN was observed in one patient, who was successfully salvaged by total parotidectomy. Potential parotid lymph node metastasis rates of T1 and T2 SCC in EAC was 0% (0/14) and 5% (1/19) respectively., CONCLUSIONS: Complete resection without positive surgical margins is essential for the treatment of the patients with T1 and T2 ear cancers. Prophylactic superficial parotidectomy or neck dissection is not mandatory for T1 and T2 diseases, as long as precisely extent of disease is assessed preoperatively. PORT should be performed for the patients with positive surgical margins., LEVELS OF EVIDENCE: 4. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  - Background: The effect of surgical margins on local recurrence in T1 glottic squamous cell carcinoma (GSCC) is unclear. Objectives: To investigate the association between surgical margins and local recurrence of T1 GSCC patients with vertical partial laryngectomy (VPL). Materials and methods: We retrospectively studied 117 T1 GSCC patients. Close and negative margins were estimated as distance <5 mm and >=5 mm. The effect of surgical margins on local recurrence was evaluated. For patients with invasion not reaching muscular-layer, a threshold margin of 2 mm was detected. Results: About 109 patients were exclusively treated by VPL and 8 patients received postoperative radiotherapy. In 109 cases, the posterolateral margins and shortest margins in recurrence group were both lower than no-recurrence group (p<.01). The ratios of posterolateral margin to average diameter, upper-lower diameter and internal-external diameter in recurrence group were also statistically lower (p<.05). A threshold margin of 2 mm showed statistical difference on recurrence in patients with invasion not reaching muscular-layer. Conclusions and significance: Posterolateral margin is crucial for local recurrence in T1 GSCC patients treated by VPL. A shortest margin of >=5 mm should be considered. For the patients with invasion not reaching the muscular-layer, a threshold of 2 mm is enough for safe margin.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Head and neck mucosal melanoma (HNMM) is a rare tumor with a poor outcome. The objective of this study was to assess outcome and prognostic factors for a cohort of patients treated in a head and neck cancer center. In addition, a case series on sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) was included to evaluate it as a method for staging the node-negative neck., METHODS: A retrospective study design was chosen, and 50 patients who were treated from 1973 to 2015 in our institution for primary HNMM were included. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate survival rates. Uni- and multivariate analyses were used to study the influence of possible risk factors on the patients' outcome. These risk factors included patient demographics, tumor characteristics, and treatment modalities., RESULTS: All patients were treated surgically and 50% received adjuvant treatment. The median disease specific survival (DSS) was 38 months, with a 5-year survival rate of 44%. Positive surgical margin (p = 0.004) and distant failure (p = 0.005) were associated with a worse DSS. The median disease-free survival (DFS) was 27 months, with a 5-year disease-free rate of 12%. Only tumor depth >5 mm (p = 0.002) was associated with a worse DFS. Five clinically node-negative patients received SLNB and only the two SLN-positive individuals suffered from distant failure. Radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and AJCC/UICC stage had no influence on any outcome measure., CONCLUSIONS: Positive surgical margin and distant failure are the only independent prognostic factors for DSS. Tumor depth can predict distant failure. SLNB may be a valuable staging tool for the node-negative neck. Copyright © 2019 European Association for Cranio-Maxillo-Facial Surgery.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the most accurate imaging modality predicting mandibular invasion in gingivobuccal (GB) complex cancers. To determine patterns of invasion and routes of tumour entry into the mandible by detailed histopathologic analysis., MATERIAL AND METHODS: Prospective observational study of GB Complex cancers juxtaposed with the mandible clinically necessitating some form of mandibular resection. Orthopantomogram (OPG), Multi Detector Computed Tomography (MDCT), DENTA scan and Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography scan (SPECT) were performed after which the patient was subjected to surgery. Histopathological assessment was systematically performed with serial cuts of the mandibular segment., RESULTS: Of 70 patients, MDCT was the most accurate with area under curve (AUC) of 0.833. OPG, DENTA and SPECT had AUC of 0.714, 0.786 and 0.738 respectively. Mean calculated difference of involved height was -0.025cm by MDCT (p value 0.87), -0.2cm by OPG (p value 0.09) and 0.12 by DENTA scan (p value 0.41). Mean difference of involved length was -0.51cm (p value 0.08) and -1.02cm (p value 0.04) for MDCT and OPG respectively. 50% of tumour invasion was through the occlusal route while large tumours demonstrated multiple routes of entry., CONCLUSION: -Gingivobuccal complex cancers are homogenous with respect to mandibular invasion, preferred route of tumour entry being the occlusal surface. -Multidetector CT scan is fairly accurate in detecting mandibular involvement and predicting extent of involvement. -Oncological safety can be achieved by positioning the bone cuts corresponding to the adjacent soft tissue margins in segmental mandibulectomy.

N2  - The 8th edition of American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC 8th) staging manual incorporated depth of invasion (DOI) into pT stage of oral cavity cancer. The aim of this study was to characterize several histological findings that may complicate measurement of DOI in early conventional squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) of the oral tongue: (1) lack of or minimal residual carcinoma following biopsy; (2) positive deep margin; (3) extratumoral perineural invasion (PNI); and (4) lymphatic or vascular invasion. Conventional SCC of the oral tongue (n = 407) with the largest dimension of <= 4 cm and with a negative elective cervical lymph node dissection (pN0) were reviewed. A clear plastic ruler was used to measure DOI by dropping a "plumb line" to the deepest point of the invasive tumor from the level of the basement membrane of the normal mucosa closest to the invasive tumor. Examples of identifying reference point on the mucosal surface of oral tongue from which to measure the DOI are illustrated. In the experience of one contributing institution, the residual carcinoma was absent in 14.2% of glossectomies (34/239), while in 4.8% of cases (10/205) there was only minimal residual carcinoma. In 11.5% (21/183) of pT2 cases the deep margin was positive and thus DOI and pT may be underestimated. Of all cases with PNI, extratumoral PNI was identified in 23.1% (31/134) of cases, but represented the deepest point of invasion in only two cases. In one case, lymphatic invasion represented the deepest point of invasion and could have led to upstaging from pT1 to pT2. In conclusion, DOI measurement for SCC of the oral tongue may require re-examination of the diagnostic biopsy in up to 20% of cases due to the absence or only minimal residual carcinoma in glossectomy specimens. In 11.5% of apparently pT2 cases, DOI may be underestimated due to the positive deep margin. Rarely, extratumoral PNI or lymphatic invasion may be the deepest point of invasion. Overall, two issues (absent or minimal residual disease and positive deep margin) may confound DOI measurement in early SCCs of oral tongue.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Tumour-positive resection margins are a major problem during oral cancer surgery. gGlu-HMRG is a tracer that becomes fluorescent upon activation by gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT). This study aims to investigate the combination of gGlu-HMRG and a clinical fluorescence imaging system for the detection of tumour-positive resection margins., MATERIALS AND METHODS: The preclinical Maestro and clinical Artemis imaging systems were compared in vitro and ex vivo with cultured human head and neck cancer cells (OSC19, GGT-positive; and FaDu, GGT negative) and tumour-bearing nude mice. Subsequently, frozen sections of normal and oral cancer tissues were ex vivo sprayed with gGlu-HMRG to determine the sensitivity and specificity. Finally, resection margins of patients with suspected oral cancer were ex vivo sprayed with gGlu-HMRG to detect tumour-positive resection margins., RESULTS: Both systems could be used to detect gGlu-HMRG activation in vitro and ex vivo in GGT positive cancer cells. Sensitivity and specificity of gGlu-HMRG and the Artemis on frozen tissue samples was 80% and 87%, respectively. Seven patients undergoing surgery for suspected oral cancer were included. In three patients fluorescence was observed at the resection margin. Those margins were either tumour-positive or within 1mm of tumour. The margins of the other patients were clear (>=8mm)., CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the feasibility to detect tumour-positive resection margins with gGlu-HMRG and a clinical fluorescence imaging system. Applying this technique would enable intraoperative screening of the entire resection margin and allow direct re-resection in case of tumour-positivity. Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Extracapsular extension (ECE) in regional lymph nodes and positive surgical margins (PSM) are considered high-risk adverse pathologic features in patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) that each constitute an indication for postoperative adjuvant chemoradiation. We identify pre-operative clinical factors that can predict post-operative ECE and/or PSM and create a nomogram to help clinical decision making., METHODS: Adult patients with non-metastatic OPSCC with initial surgical treatment and confirmed HPV status diagnosed between 2010 and 2014 were selected from the National Cancer Database. Clinical staging was modified to American Joint Committee on Cancer 8th edition parameters. Logistic regression was used for multivariate analysis to identify predictors of pathologic ECE and/or PSM., RESULTS: 5065 patients were included. 47.5% of the 3336 HPV-positive (HPV+) patients had ECE/PSM. 40.4% of the 1729 HPV-negative (HPV-) patients with had ECE/PSM. A model was built that included age, clinical ECE, tumor grade, and clinical T and N staging for HPV+ patients. Increasing N-classification was highly predictive of pathologic ECE and/or PSM (N1 OR=3.6, N2 OR=7.0, N3 OR=11.2, p<0.01). Clinical ECE (OR=4.1, p<0.01), tumor grade (ORs 2.2-4.4 with p<0.05), and increasing clinical T-classification (ORs 1.2-1.8, p<0.05) were also associated with ECE and/or PSM. A similar model was built for HPV- with similar predictive capability. Two internally validated nomograms were designed that demonstrated good discrimination (HPV+ AUC=0.66, 95% CI: 0.64-0.68, and HPV- AUC=0.70, 95% CI: 0.67-0.72) and good calibration (goodness-of-fit statistic of HPV+ 6.32, p=0.61 and HPV- 11.66, p=0.17)., CONCLUSIONS: These are the first nomograms designed to help predict ECE or PSM for both HPV+ and HPV- OPSCC. The nomograms can facilitate shared decision-making between clinicians and patients as they consider upfront treatment selection for OPSCC. Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - BACKGROUND: This study describes the results of elective irradiation in the N0 neck and tries to identify prognostic factors for regional recurrence., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 1985 and 2000, 785 cN0 or pN0 necks were treated with elective nodal irradiation in 619 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients., RESULTS: Regional control at 3 years was 94% in the cN0 (nondissected) neck compared with 97% in the pN0 (dissected) neck and 90% in the ipsilateral compared with 96% in the contralateral neck (P = 0.08 and P = 0.006, respectively). Regional control in the ipsilateral cN0 neck was 78% compared with 96% in the contralateral cN0 neck. Surgical margin of the primary tumor was an additional prognostic factor in all N0 and pN0 necks., CONCLUSIONS: Neck control rates in electively irradiated N0 necks were excellent. Regional control was worse in the cN0 neck compared with the pN0 neck and in the ipsilateral neck compared with the contralateral side. Additionally, in case of positive surgical margins of the primary tumor, elective nodal irradiation should be applied, even in case of a pN0 neck.

N2  - Necrotizing sialometaplasia (NSM) is a benign, reactive metaplastic condition of the minor salivary gland tissue typically seen in the setting of injury, chemical or traumatic, and is nonneoplastic and self-limited. The diagnosis may be challenging as it may clinically mimic malignancy. We present the case of a 74-year-old male with a 1 pack per day smoking history for 60 years who presented with a reported 20-pound weight loss, dysphagia, and dysphonia progressing over the course of 6 months and found to have a 3.5-cm hypopharyngeal mass on computed tomography imaging and fiberoptic laryngoscopy. Initial frozen section of the mass was concerning for squamous cell carcinoma in situ, but permanent specimens returned as nondiagnostic. Repeat biopsy established a diagnosis of NSM. Two-month follow-up showed complete resolution of the mass. Clinicians should be aware that NSM may present in unusual locations when considering differential diagnoses for laryngeal masses and evaluating for malignancy.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to review our recent experience of salvage surgery, comparing larynx and oropharynx recurrence patterns., METHODS: A single centre, retrospective review of salvage surgery for recurrent head and neck cancer including patients between 2008 and 2016., RESULTS: 61 patients were identified, 36 underwent salvage laryngectomy and 25 received oropharyngeal resections. The median overall survival of oropharyngeal recurrent tumors was 26 months (95% CI 15-118 months) and for laryngeal tumors was 23 months (95% CI 11-38 months), p = 0.1008. There was a significant overall survival benefit in patients with negative resection margin. The median survival in the negative margin group was 38 months (95% CI 25-108 months) compared to the positive margin group, 9 months (95% CI 5-15 months), p < 0.0001., CONCLUSION: Survival results following surgical salvage in the larynx and oropharynx appear to be similarly poor. Those patients with clear margins appear to have a significantly better prognosis.

This article describes clear cell variant of myoepithelioma in the tongue base, which has not been reported in the literature so far. A 34-year-old man presented with dysphagia and foreign body sensation of throat. Video laryngostroboscopy using a 70degree rigid telescope showed a smooth globular mass in the oropharynx arising from the tongue base. Based on clinical and radiological findings, the lesion was considered as benign. Fine needle aspiration cytology was not attempted fearing risk of bleeding, aspiration and airway compromise. Hence, an excisional biopsy followed by definitive histopathological examination without frozen section was planned. The patient underwent coblator-assisted excision and subsequently sent for histopathological analysis. There were cuboidal cell nests with abundant clear cytoplasm which stained positive for p63 by immunohistochemistry. This helped in establishing the diagnosis of clear cell myoepithelioma.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The status of surgical margins is the most important prognosticator for patients undergoing surgical resection of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Despite this, analysis of surgical margins is fraught with inconsistencies, including the ways in which margins are sampled and interpreted. Fundamentally, even the definition what constitutes a "clear" (or negative) margin may vary between institutions, surgeons, and pathologists., METHODS: The PubMed database was queried for articles relevant to the topic, and experts in the field were consulted regarding key articles for inclusion. Abstracts were reviewed and the full text was accessed for articles of particular interest., RESULTS: Data regarding various approaches to traditional margin analysis have been published without consensus. Several next-generation technologies have emerged in recent years that hold promise., CONCLUSION: An overview and appraisal of traditional margin analysis techniques are provided. Additionally, we explore novel technologies that may assist in more accurate margin assessment, guide the extent of surgical resections intraoperatively, and inform decisions regarding adjuvant treatment postoperatively.

N2  - BACKGROUND: This study elucidates the clinical impact of surgical treatment of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) based on a detailed search of all exons of the TP53 gene and p53 protein phenotypic analysis using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens., METHODS: Clinically well-annotated FFPE specimens from 317 patients with HNSCC treated by surgery were examined by all-exon TP53 sequencing using a next-generation sequencer and p53 protein phenotype by immunohistochemistry. After excluding human papillomavirus-associated oropharyngeal carcinomas, two risk categories were classified as "p53 adverse function" and "p53 favorable function" based on TP53 mutation status and p53 protein phenotype. Mutation in PIK3CA, AKT, and HRAS was also evaluated by target sequence. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used for statistical analysis of clinical outcomes. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to determine the optimal surgical margin cutoff for local recurrence. Local control rates were compared between the risk groups using Fisher's exact test., RESULTS: Multivariate analysis identified "p53 adverse function" as an independent poor predictor of overall survival, local control, and distant metastasis-free survival. In oral cavity cancer, the optimal surgical margin cutoff associated with local recurrence was 6 mm. In patients with surgical margin > 6 mm, the "p53 adverse function" group demonstrated significantly higher local recurrence rate than the "p53 favorable function" group. PIK3CA, AKT, or HRAS mutation did not correlate with improved overall survival., CONCLUSIONS: All-exon TP53 sequencing and p53 protein phenotype analysis using FFPE specimens can accurately predict clinical outcomes.

N2  - Background: Adjuvant chemoradiation (CRT) is standard for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients with positive margins or extranodal extension (ENE) following surgery. However, emerging evidence suggests the number of positive lymph nodes (LNs) is the dominant determinant of survival in non-oropharyngeal HNSCC and thus may better identify those benefiting from treatment intensification., Patients and methods: Patients from the National Cancer Database diagnosed with non-oropharyngeal HNSCC (oral cavity, larynx, hypopharynx) between 2004 and 2014 and undergoing surgical resection, neck dissection, and postoperative radiotherapy (RT) were included. Multivariable regression with first-order interaction terms was used to model the interaction between postoperative CRT and continuous number of positive LNs with respect to overall survival., Results: In total, 7144 patients met inclusion criteria. In multivariable analysis, increasing number of positive LNs was associated with both increasing mortality (P < 0.001) and increasing benefit from postoperative CRT versus RT alone (interaction P < 0.001). While there was no benefit from postoperative CRT in patients with 0-2 LN+ [hazard ratio (HR) 0.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.86-1.07, P = 0.47], increased benefit was seen in those with 3-5 LN+ (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.70-1.00, P = 0.05) and those with >=6 LN+ (HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.51-0.82, P < 0.001) in multivariable models. By contrast, margin status and ENE did not reliably identify patients benefitting from postoperative CRT based on statistical tests of interaction. Even in patients with ENE, positive margins, or both, only those with >=6 LN+ had improved survival with postoperative CRT., Conclusion: Increasing metastatic nodal burden was associated with increased benefit from CRT compared with RT alone, surpassing conventional high-risk factors in identifying patients benefiting from CRT. Stratification by metastatic LN number may characterize a very-high-risk patient cohort best suited for treatment intensification.

N2  - Importance: The achievement of complete tumor resection with tumor-free margins is one of the main principles of oncologic surgery for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). The negative prognostic influence of a positive margin (PM) across all head and neck subsites has been well established. National guidelines recommend the use of adjuvant chemoradiation therapy (CRT) in the setting of PM., Objective: To determine the incidence of PM in HNSCC across multiple subsites, as well as the factors associated with its occurrence., Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study used the National Cancer Database to identify patients diagnosed with HNSCC between 2010 and 2014 and who underwent surgical resection (n = 28840)., Main Outcomes and Measures: Predictors of PM rate and likelihood to receive adjuvant CRT., Results: Among the 28840 patients included in this study, 19727 (68.4 %) were men, and the average age was 62.4 years (range, 40 to >=90 years). In univariable analysis, a lower PM rate was associated with higher facility volume (26.3% for the lowest volume quartile, 16.5% for the middle 2 quartiles, and 10.8% for the highest volume quartile) and treatment at academic vs nonacademic facilities (14.0% vs 22.7%). In multivariate analysis, those treated at higher-volume facilities remained significantly less likely to have PM (adjusted odds ratio, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.83-0.88). The trend of decreasing PM rate with increasing facility volume was observed in both academic (aOR, 0.88 per 10-case volume increase [95% CI, 0.85-0.91]) and nonacademic (aOR, 0.73 per 10-case volume increase [95% CI, 0.68-0.80]) facilities. There was no association between facility volume and patient likelihood of receiving adjuvant CRT in the setting of PM (compared with CCPs: aOR, 0.98 per 10-case volume increase [95% CI, 0.84-1.14] for CCCPs; and aOR, 1.24 [95% CI, 0.99-1.55] for INCPs)., Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that high-volume facilities are associated with lower rates of PM in the surgical treatment of HNSCC in both academic and nonacademic settings. Facility volume for head and neck oncologic surgeries may be considered a benchmark for quality of care.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Up to half of patients with oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OCSCC) have stage I to II disease. When adequate resection is attained, no further treatment is needed; however, re-resection or radiotherapy may be indicated for patients with positive or close margins. This multicenter study evaluated the outcomes and role of adjuvant treatment in patients with stage I to II OCSCC., METHODS: Overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival, local-free survival, and disease-free survival rates were calculated with Kaplan-Meier analysis., RESULTS: Of 1257 patients with T1-2N0M0 disease, 33 (2.6%) had positive margins, and 205 (16.3%) had close margins. The 5-year OS rate was 80% for patients with clear margins, 52% for patients with close margins, and 63% for patients with positive margins (P < .0001). In a multivariate analysis, age, depth of invasion, and margins were independent predictors of outcome. Close margins were associated with a >2-fold increase in the risk of recurrence (P < .0001). The multivariate analysis revealed that adjuvant treatment significantly improved the outcomes of patients with close/positive margins (P = .002 to .03)., CONCLUSIONS: Patients with stage I to II OCSCC and positive/close margins have poor long-term outcomes. For this population, adjuvant treatment may be associated with improved survival. Cancer 2018;124:2948-55. © 2018 American Cancer Society. Copyright © 2018 American Cancer Society.

N2  - Objective To conduct a multivariate analysis of a large cohort of oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OCSCC) cases for independent predictors of local recurrence (LR) and overall survival (OS), with emphasis on the relationship between (1) prognosis and (2) main specimen permanent margins and intraoperative tumor bed frozen margins. Study Design Retrospective cohort study. Setting Tertiary academic head and neck cancer program. Subjects and Methods This study included 426 patients treated with OCSCC resection between 2005 and 2014 at University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics. Patients underwent excision of OCSCC with intraoperative tumor bed frozen margin sampling and main specimen permanent margin assessment. Multivariate analysis of the data set to predict LR and OS was performed. Results Independent predictors of LR included nodal involvement, histologic grade, and main specimen permanent margin status. Specifically, the presence of a positive margin (odds ratio, 6.21; 95% CI, 3.3-11.9) or <1-mm/carcinoma in situ margin (odds ratio, 2.41; 95% CI, 1.19-4.87) on the main specimen was an independent predictor of LR, whereas intraoperative tumor bed margins were not predictive of LR on multivariate analysis. Similarly, independent predictors of OS on multivariate analysis included nodal involvement, extracapsular extension, and a positive main specimen margin. Tumor bed margins did not independently predict OS. Conclusion The main specimen margin is a strong independent predictor of LR and OS on multivariate analysis. Intraoperative tumor bed frozen margins do not independently predict prognosis. We conclude that emphasis should be placed on evaluating the main specimen margins when estimating prognosis after OCSCC resection.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To determine if adjuvant radiation therapy for patients with pT2N0 oral cavity tongue cancer affects overall survival., STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study., SETTING: National Cancer Database., SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Cases diagnosed between 2004 and 2013 with pathologic stage pT2N0 oral cavity tongue cancer with negative surgical margins were extracted from the National Cancer Database. Data were stratified by treatment received, including surgery only and surgery + postoperative radiation therapy. Univariate analysis was performed with a 2-sample t test, chi-square test, or Fisher exact test and log-rank test, while multivariate analysis was performed with Cox regression models adjusted for individual variables as well as a propensity score., RESULTS: A total of 934 patients were included in the study, with 27.5% of patients receiving surgery with postoperative radiation therapy (n = 257). In univariate analysis, there was no significant difference in 3-year overall survival between the patient groups ( P = .473). In multivariate analysis, there was no significant difference in survival between the treatment groups, with adjuvant radiation therapy having a hazard ratio of 0.93 (95% CI, 0.60-1.44; P = .748). Regarding tumors with a depth of invasion >5 mm, there was no survival benefit for the patients who received postoperative radiation therapy as compared with those who received surgery alone (hazard ratio = 0.93; 95% CI, 0.57-1.53; P = .769)., CONCLUSION: An overall survival benefit was not demonstrated for patients who received postoperative radiation therapy versus surgery alone for pT2N0 oral cavity tongue cancer, irrespective of depth of tumor invasion.

N2  - Surgical margin principle is one of the central surgical principles for head and neck cancers. Negative surgical margin is the primary purpose of surgery for head and neck cancers. This paper is based on the current clinical application of surgical margins of head and neck cancers, and it is proposed that surgical margins of head and neck cancers may be classified into three types: surface margin, deep margin, and tissue interface margin in consideration of surgical exposure of tumors. The classification of surgical margins can make the clinical application and the research of surgical margins of head and neck cancers more systematic and clear.

N2  - The efficacy and safety of endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) for superficial cancer of the pharynx are still unclear. To identify clinicopathological features of superficial pharyngeal cancer, and the efficacy and safety of ESD, we retrospectively assessed 70 pharyngeal cancers in 59 patients who underwent ESD. Of these patients, 61.0% and 50.8% had a history of esophageal cancer and head and neck cancer, respectively. The median tumor size was 15 mm, and 75.7% of the lesions were located at the piriform sinus. The en bloc resection rate was 94.9%. Treatment-related adverse events occurred in 8 cases, but there was no treatment-related death. The lateral margin was positive for neoplasm in 3 lesions (4.3%) and inconclusive in 27 lesions (38.6%), but no local recurrence was observed. Cervical lymph node metastasis was observed in 6 patients, and was successfully treated by cervical lymph node dissection. The three-year overall survival rate was 91.5% (95%CI: 76.6-97.3%) and the cause-specific survival rate was 97.6% (95%CI: 84.9-99.7%). In conclusion, ESD for superficial pharyngeal cancer was safe and effective. "Resect and watch" is probably a feasible and rational strategy for treatment of patients with superficial pharyngeal cancer.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the incidence of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma in patients with an isolated cervical cystic mass, and to describe the clinical features that might predict the origin of cystic tumours., METHOD: Adult patients with isolated lateral cervical cystic masses who were scheduled for surgery from 1st January 2010 to 31st August 2016 in two tertiary care referral centres in Slovakia were analysed retrospectively., RESULTS: The incidence of cystic metastases in the whole cohort and in patients aged over 40 years were 9.9 per cent and 18.5 per cent, respectively. The incidence in patients aged over 40 years (18.5 per cent) was statistically significant (p = 0.003)., CONCLUSION: The incidence of cystic squamous cell carcinoma metastases in lateral cervical cysts in patients aged over 40 years is high enough to call for excisional biopsy with frozen section, panendoscopy with direct biopsies, tonsillectomy and even neck dissection in cases of histologically confirmed carcinoma.

Y1  - 2019//
N2  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To identify and review the recent literature on clinical applications, outcome, and new developments in photodynamic therapy (PDT) for the treatment of head and neck cancer., RECENT FINDINGS: Although PDT and surgery have a similar local control and recurrence rate, the gold standard of treatment for early-stage oral cavity cancer remains local surgery with, on indication, concurrent treatment of the neck. PDT proves its value in treatment of patients with field cancerization and patients with superficial recurrence after previous surgery and/or radiation, in whom surgical salvage would entail important morbidity. PDT is also promising as an adjuvant treatment after surgery in the presence of macroscopic or microscopic involved margins, in patients where reresection or reirradiation would imply an unacceptable risk. Recent progress in the field of PDT focuses on development and clinical application of new photosensitizing agents, photochemical internalization, and photoimmunotherapy., SUMMARY: The value of PDT in specific well-selected head and neck cancer clinical scenarios is well established. The basic research field is rapidly evolving and experimental findings are promising, maybe eventually leading to optimized results, less side-effects, and more indications.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Frozen section evaluation is routinely used by oncosurgeons across specialties for rapid assessment of the presence of tumor in any tissue and its most common use is in surgical margins. Today, the use of intraoperative frozen-section evaluation of surgical margins is an accepted and frequent practice in head and neck oncology. This study aims to determine the efficacy and accuracy of frozen sections in head and neck cancer patients and compare the results with the respective paraffin sections and also to analyze the reasons for any disparity between them., MATERIAL AND METHOD: A retrospective study was conducted to evaluate efficacy and accuracy of frozen section in head and neck cancer of 265 patients, treated at a tertiary cancer centre hospital between January 2013 to December 2014., RESULTS: Out of 265 cases, it was found that 12.6% of these sections showed true positivity, 6.3% false positivity, 2.9% false negativity and 78.2% true negativity. The study also shows a sensitivity of 82.05% and specificity of 96.46%., CONCLUSION: Our study shows that intraoperative frozen section reports are specific and highly sensitive. We recommend a minimum of 3-4 sections, optimum cryostat temperature, good section thickness and quality staining for a good concordance rate.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Recurrence of oral squamous cell carcinoma (rOSCC) after primary treatment is associated with poor survival outcomes. Salvage treatment with further surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy has high morbidity, making patient selection crucial. However, in the recurrence setting, reliable stratification data are scarce. Decision-making in this context is consequently complex. We investigated factors influencing overall survival after rOSCC., METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of patients with rOSCC (n = 83) at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham, UK between 2006 and 2016. Associations with overall survival were analysed using univariate and multivariate analyses to identify important clinical prognostic indicators., RESULTS: Overall survival at 1 year was 32.5% and at 5 years was 18.1% after a median follow-up of 7.4 months. Multivariate analysis identified four independent predictors of overall survival following rOSCC: size of primary tumour (HR 2.077; 95% CI 1.034-4.172), extent of recurrent disease (HR 3.286; 95% CI 1.545-6.991), history of moderate alcohol consumption (HR 0.351; 95% CI 0.162-0.763), and close or positive margins at primary resection (HR 1.955; 95% CI 1.063-3.595)., CONCLUSIONS: We identified four key factors that help prognostication and risk stratification of rOSCC. Given the high morbidity associated with salvage treatment, we recommend that the multidisciplinary team (MDT) and the patient weigh these factors carefully when considering further treatment. Further investigation of the biology underlying these oncophenotypes may contribute to better patient stratification. Copyright © 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To compare long-term oncologic outcomes and adjuvant therapies for patients treated with transoral robotic surgery (TORS), nonrobotic surgery, or transoral laser microsurgery (TLM)., STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective analysis of the National Cancer Database (2010-2014)., METHODS: Patients with clinical tumor (T)1 and T2 oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas (OPSCC) were classified into those receiving TORS versus nonrobotic surgery versus TLM. Univariate and multivariate survival analyses were conducted with chi-square tests; Kaplan-Meier log-rank test; and Cox multivariate, logistic regression, and multinomial regression modeling., RESULTS: We identified 2,224 OPSCC TORS patients; 6,697 nonrobotic surgery patients; and 333 TLM patients. The majority of patients were white males with a mean age of approximately 59 years. No significant difference was noted between the cohorts in tumor stage; however, TORS patients were more likely to have nodal (N)1 to N3 disease than nonrobotic surgery and TLM patients, respectively (69.8% vs. 62.0% vs. 59.7%, P < 0.001). TORS was associated with a lower likelihood of positive margins when compared to nonrobotic surgery, although not TLM (nonrobotic surgery: hazard ratio [HR] 1.51, P < 0.001, TLM: HR 1.13, P = 0.582). TORS was associated with lower likelihood of postsurgical chemoradiotherapy (TLM: HR 2.07, P < 0.001, nonrobotic surgery: 1.65, P < 0.001) but not adjuvant radiotherapy alone (TLM: HR 1.06, P = 0.569, nonrobotic surgery: 0.96, P = 0.655). On multivariate Cox analysis of overall survival, the use of TORS was not associated with increased survival (TLM: HR 1.31, P = 0.233, nonrobotic surgery: HR 1.12, P < 0.303)., CONCLUSION: The advantages of TORS for early-stage OPSCC may be a lower likelihood of postsurgical positive margins and subsequent need for adjuvant chemoradiotherapy., LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: NA Laryngoscope, 129:1844-1855, 2019.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To provide a perspective on the significance of recent reports for optimizing cancer free surgical margins that have challenged standard practices., METHODS: We conducted a review of the recent literature (2012-2018) using the keywords surgical margin analysis, frozen and paraffin section techniques, head and neck cancer, spectroscopy and molecular markers., RESULTS: Of significance are the reports indicating superiority of tumor specimen directed sampling of margins compared to patient directed (tumor bed) sampling for frozen section control of oral cancers. With reference to optimal distance between tumor and the surgical margin, recent reports recommended cutoffs less than 5mm. Employment of new technologies such as light spectroscopy and molecular analysis of tissues, provide opportunities for a "real time" assessment of surgical margins., CONCLUSIONS: The commonly practiced method of patient directed margin sampling involving previous studies raises concern over conclusions made regarding the efficacy of frozen section margin control. The recent studies that challenge the optimal distance for clear surgical margins are retrospective and address patient cohorts with inherently confounding factors. The use of novel ancillary techniques require further refinements, clinical trial validation, and justification based on the additional resources. Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  - Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) represents the most common type of head and neck cancer worldwide. However, despite advances in cancer care globally there has been little progress in HNSCC, with survival remaining static and slightly worse in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma with 5 year survivals remaining at ~50%. Conventional analysis of tissue through cytopathology or histopathology are the mainstay of diagnosis. Furthermore there are no useful biomarkers for disease diagnosis or surveillance. With recent technological advances, particularly in next generation sequencing, here we explore the application of tumor DNA for HNSCC diagnosis and surveillance, to improve surgical margin analysis and the potential use of molecular agents aiding in the imaging of HNSCC.

N2  - Accurately identifying close or positive margins in real-time permits re-excision during surgical procedures. Intraoperative assessment of margins via gross examination and frozen section is a widely used tool to assist the surgeon in achieving complete resection. While this methodology permits diagnosis of freshly resected tissue, the process is fraught with misinterpretation and sampling errors. During fluorescence-guided surgery, an exogenous fluorescent agent specific for the target disease is imaged in order to navigate the surgical excision. As this technique quickly advances into the clinic, we hypothesize that the disease-specific fluorescence inherently contained within the resected tissues can be used to guide histopathological assessment. To evaluate the feasibility of fluorescence-guided pathology, we evaluated head and neck squamous cell carcinoma tumour specimens and margins resected from animals and patients after systemic injection of cetuximab-IRDye800CW. In a preclinical model of luciferase-positive tumour resection using bioluminescence as the gold standard, fluorescence assessment determined by closed-field fluorescence imaging of fresh resected margins accurately predicted the presence of disease in 33/39 positive margins yielding an overall sensitivity of 85%, specificity of 95%, positive predictive value (PPV) of 94%, and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 87%, which was superior to both surgical assessment (54%, 61%, 57%, and 58%) and pathological assessment (49%, 95%, 91%, and 66%), respectively. When the power of the technique was evaluated using human-derived tumour tissues, as little as 0.5mg (1mm(3)) of tumour tissue was identified (tumour-to-background-ratio:5.2). When the sensitivity/specificity of fluorescence-guided pathology was determined using traditional histological assessment as the gold standard in human tissues obtained during fluorescence-guided surgery, the technique was highly accurate with a sensitivity of 91%, specificity of 85%, PPV of 81%, and NPV of 93% for 90 human-derived samples. This approach can be used as a companion to the pathologist, eliminating confounding factors while impacting surgical intervention and patient management.

N2  - Importance: Frozen-section analysis of margin status is routinely performed during total laryngectomy for squamous cell carcinoma; in the case of positive initial frozen margins, re-resection to negative margins can often be accomplished. Some evidence suggests that positive initial margins may be associated with worse survival among patients with head and neck cancer even when final margins are negative, but the significance of positive initial frozen margins in total laryngectomy is poorly understood., Objective: To determine the association between disease-free survival and positive initial margins among patients treated with total laryngectomy for squamous cell carcinoma., Design, Setting, and Participants: In this retrospective cohort study conducted at a tertiary care center, records of 237 consecutive patients treated with total laryngectomy for squamous cell carcinoma from February 2008 to July 2016 were reviewed for demographic characteristics, disease staging, pathologic markers, and outcomes. Margins were considered to be positive if they contained invasive carcinoma, carcinoma in situ, or severe dysplasia. Data analysis was performed from March to June 2018., Interventions: All patients had undergone total laryngectomy for squamous cell carcinoma., Main Outcomes and Measures: Variables associated with disease-free survival were analyzed using a univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards model., Results: Among all 225 patients (184 [92%] male; mean age, 63.9 years; range, 30-92 years) who underwent total laryngectomy and had negative final margins, 127 patients underwent primary total laryngectomy and 98 underwent salvage total laryngectomy, with mean (SEM) follow-up of 29.3 (1.8) months. Initial frozen margins were positive in 40 of 225 patients (18%); positive initial margins occurred in 21 of 127 patients who underwent primary total laryngectomy (17%) and in 19 of 98 patients who underwent salvage total laryngectomy (19%). On multivariable analysis, only salvage laryngectomy was associated with significantly worse disease-free survival (hazard ratio [HR], 3.35; 95% CI, 1.76-6.36). Among 98 patients who underwent salvage total laryngectomy, positive lymph nodes, lymphovascular invasion, extracapsular nodal extension, and adjuvant therapy were associated with worse disease-free survival on univariable analysis, but no factors remained significant on multivariable analysis. Among 127 patients who underwent primary total laryngectomy, positive nodes, lymphovascular invasion, extracapsular nodal extension, and positive initial margins were associated with worse disease-free survival; however, only positive initial margins were associated with significantly worse disease-free survival on multivariable analysis (HR, 5.01; 95% CI, 1.55-16.2)., Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, positive initial margins were associated with worse disease-free survival among patients who underwent primary total laryngectomy despite negative margins on final pathologic examination. This finding may indicate aggressive tumor behavior in the context of primary laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma.

N2  - For many solid tumors, surgical resection remains the gold standard and tumor-involved margins are associated with poor clinical outcomes. Near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging using molecular agents has shown promise for in situ imaging during resection. However, for cancers with difficult imaging conditions, surgical value may lie in tumor mapping of surgical specimens. We thus evaluated a novel approach for real-time, intraoperative tumor margin assessment. Twenty-one adult patients with biopsy-confirmed squamous cell carcinoma arising from the head and neck (HNSCC) scheduled for standard-of-care surgery were enrolled. Cohort 1 (n = 3) received panitumumab-IRDye800CW at an intravenous microdose of 0.06 mg/kg, cohort 2A (n = 5) received 0.5 mg/kg, cohort 2B (n = 7) received 1 mg/kg, and cohort 3 (n = 6) received 50 mg. Patients were followed 30 days postinfusion and adverse events were recorded. Imaging was performed using several closed- and wide-field devices. Fluorescence was histologically correlated to determine sensitivity and specificity. In situ imaging demonstrated tumor-to-background ratio (TBR) of 2 to 3, compared with ex vivo specimen imaging TBR of 5 to 6. We obtained clear differentiation between tumor and normal tissue, with a 3-fold signal difference between positive and negative specimens (P < 0.05). We achieved high correlation of fluorescence intensity with tumor location with sensitivities and specificities >89%; fluorescence predicted distance of tumor tissue to the cut surface of the specimen. This novel method of detecting tumor-involved margins in surgical specimens using a cancer-specific agent provides highly sensitive and specific, real-time, intraoperative surgical navigation in resections with complex anatomy, which are otherwise less amenable to image guidance. Significance: This study demonstrates that fluorescence can be used as a sensitive and specific method of guiding surgeries for head and neck cancers and potentially other cancers with challenging imaging conditions, increasing the probability of complete resections and improving oncologic outcomes.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) are associated with an interplay between genetics and the environment; they account for 3% of all diagnosed malignant tumors in men and 2% of those in women., OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to analyze the significance of TIMP3, SFRP1, SFRP2, CDH1, RASSF1, RORA, and DAPK1 gene expression in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma tumors, and in matching surgical margin samples. We also analyzed the association between clinical parameters and the expression of the selected genes., MATERIAL AND METHODS: Following surgical resection, 56 primary HNSCC tumors and matching surgical margin samples were collected from patients at the Clinic of Oncological and Reconstructive Surgery of Maria Sklodowska-Curie Memorial Cancer Center and the Institute of Oncology in Gliwice, Poland. The gene expression levels were analyzed by quantitative reverse transcription (qRT)-PCR., RESULTS: SFRP1 gene expression was statistically significantly lower in the tumor samples than in the surgical margins (0.30 +/-0.36 vs 0.62 +/-0.36; p < 0.01). No correlation was found between gene expression and clinical parameters, except DAPK1, where low expression correlated with alcohol abuse (0.85 +/-1.19 vs 1.97 +/-3.22; p = 0.074). Moreover, patients with G3 grade tumors, i.e., poorly differentiated tumors, had significantly higher values of DAPK1 gene expression than the G1 (well-differentiated tumors) and G2 (moderately differentiated) groups., CONCLUSIONS: There are many different reasons and concepts for altered gene expression in tumors and surgical margin tissue. Tumor heterogeneity and its microenvironment are undoubtedly linked to the biology of HNSCC. In order to understand specific tumor behavior and the microenvironment, further studies are needed. To find markers connected with cancer development and to provide insight into the earliest stages of cancer development, attention should also be focused on molecular analysis of the surgical margins.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to demonstrate the feasibility and efficacy of induction chemotherapy, surgery, and pathology-guided adjuvant therapy to treat transorally resectable squamous head and neck cancer., METHODS: Patients had squamous head and neck cancer that was resectable by the transoral route and advanced-stage disease (American Joint Committee on Cancer stage III-IV, T3-T4 tumors, and/or positive lymph nodes). They received treatment with weekly carboplatin at an area under the curve of 2, plus paclitaxel 135 mg/m2 , and daily lapatinib 1000mg for 6 weeks followed by surgical resection. Pathology that revealed margins <5 mm, extracapsular extension, N2a of N2b lymph node status, perineural invasion, or lymphovascular space invasion resulted in adjuvant radiotherapy concurrent with weekly cisplatin. Pathology with N2c/N3 lymph node status or positive margins resulted in radiation with bolus cisplatin. The primary endpoint was the clinical response rate to induction chemotherapy, and a key secondary endpoint was feasibility., RESULTS: Toxicity was modest, and 37 of 40 patients completed study procedures as planned. The clinical response rate was 93%, the pathologic complete response rate was 36%, and the clinical response did not predict for a pathologic complete response. No patient on study follow-up has recurred or died. Twenty-nine of 39 patients who underwent surgery avoided radiation. Speech and swallowing function were well preserved., CONCLUSIONS: The study met both its primary efficacy endpoint and the secondary feasibility endpoint. Neoadjuvant, systemic therapy and surgical resection followed by risk-adapted adjuvant therapy resulted in high response rates and excellent long-term outcomes and should be further studied.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Determination of tumor margins in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) is mostly based on preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography scans (CT). Local recurrence of disease is often correlated with the presence of positive resection margins after surgical treatment. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging plays a crucial role in the assessment of patients with SCCHN. The purpose of this study was to determine whether PET/CT could predict tumor extension., METHODS: In 12 patients who underwent surgical treatment of primary SCCHN (Stage III-IV) F18-FDG PET/CT image-fusion was performed on a 3D navigation-system based workstation. Image-guided needle biopsies were obtained from four different, color-coded metabolic areas within the tumor. The histopathological findings were correlated with findings on corresponding PET/CT scans., RESULTS: 81.3% of biopsies from the central area were positive. Specimens taken from the outer metabolic zone were positive in 66.7% of the patients. The highest incidence of positive biopsies was found in the zone adjacent to the outermost area. There was a statistically significant difference in positive tumor histopathology when comparing the various metabolic zones (p = 0.03)., CONCLUSION: Exact determination of tumor is an important research topic, although results remain controversial. The results of this study suggest that in some cases PET scans may overestimate tumor extension. Copyright © 2018. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Having previously initiated genome-wide expression profiling in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) for regions of the tumor, the margin of surgical resecate (MSR) and normal mucosa (NM), we here proceed with respective analysis of cases after stratification according to the expression status of tenascin (Ten)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Tissue specimens of each anatomical site were analyzed by immunofluorescent detection of Ten, fibronectin (Fn) and galectin-1 (Gal-1) as well as by microarrays., RESULTS: Histopathological examination demonstrated that Ten+Fn+Gal-1+ co-expression occurs more frequently in samples of HNSCC (55%) than in NM (9%; p<0.01). Contrary, the Ten-Fn+Gal-1- (45%) and Ten-Fn-Gal-1- (39%) status occurred with significantly (p<0.01) higher frequency than in HNSCC (3% and 4%, respectively). In MSRs, different immunophenotypes were distributed rather equally (Ten+Fn+Gal-1+=24%; Ten-Fn+Gal-1-=36%; Ten-Fn-Gal-1-=33%), differing to the results in tumors (p<0.05). Absence/presence of Ten was used for stratification of patients into cohorts without a difference in prognosis, to comparatively examine gene-activity signatures. Microarray analysis revealed i) expression of several tumor progression-associated genes in Ten+ HNSCC tumors and ii) a strong up-regulation of gene expression assigned to lipid metabolism in MSRs of Ten- tumors, while NM profiles remained similar., CONCLUSION: The presented data reveal marked and specific changes in tumors and MSR specimens of HNSCC without a separation based on prognosis.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Postoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT) is considered standard of care in patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer with positive margins and/or extracapsular extension (ECE)., METHODS: The National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) was queried to identify patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck with stages III to IVB disease or with positive margins and/or ECE diagnosed between 2004 and 2012 receiving postoperative radiotherapy (RT). Using univariable and multivariable logistic and Cox regression, we assessed for predictors of CRT use and covariables impacting overall survival (OS), including in a propensity-matched subset., RESULTS: Of 12 224 patients, 67.1% with positive margins and/or ECE received CRT as well as 54.0% without positive margins and/or ECE. The 5-year OS was 61.6% for RT alone versus 67.4% for CRT. In the propensity-matched cohort, OS benefit persisted with CRT, including in a subset with positive margins and/or ECE but not without., CONCLUSION: Postoperative CRT seems underutilized with positive margins and/or ECE and overutilized without positive margins and/or ECE. The CRT was associated with improved OS but the benefit persisted only in the subset with positive margins and/or ECE. Copyright © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of Raman spectroscopy for detection of oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OCSCC) in bone resection surfaces during mandibulectomy., MATERIALS & METHODS: Raman mapping experiments were performed on fresh mandible resection specimens from patients treated with mandibulectomy for OCSCC. A tumour detection algorithm was created based on water concentration and the high-wavenumber range (2800 cm-1-3050 cm-1) of the Raman spectra., RESULTS: Twenty-six ex vivo Raman mapping experiments were performed on 26 fresh mandible resection specimens obtained from 22 patients. The algorithm was applied on an independent test set and showed an accuracy of 95%, a sensitivity of 95%, and a specificity of 87%., CONCLUSION: These results form the basis for further development of a Raman spectroscopy tool as an objective method for intraoperative assessment of bone resection margins.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Postoperative concomitant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) improves outcomes for younger adults with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and positive margins or extranodal extension (ENE), but its benefit for older adults is not well established., METHODS: Patients from the National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) with HNSCC undergoing curative-intent resection, neck dissection, and postoperative radiation with positive margins or ENE were identified., RESULTS: This analysis included 1199 patients aged >= 70 years with median follow-up of 42.6 months. Postoperative concurrent CRT was associated with improved overall survival (OS; hazard ratio [HR] 0.752; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.638-0.886) compared to radiation alone in multivariable analysis. Three-year OS was 52.4% with CRT versus 43.4% with radiation (P = .012) in propensity-score matched cohorts. The survival impact of CRT varied by N classification (P = .002 for interaction), with benefit seen only in those with N2 to N3 disease., CONCLUSION: Postoperative concurrent CRT may benefit older patients with HNSCC with positive margins or ENE, particularly those with higher nodal burden.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy (surgery + adjuvant RT) versus adjuvant chemoradiotherapy (surgery + adjuvant CRT) in patients with T4N0M0, stage IV head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC)., METHODS: Between 1998 and 2011, 3518 and 885 patients were treated with surgery + adjuvant RT and surgery + adjuvant CRT, respectively. Three-year overall survival (OS) rates were determined and crude and adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed., RESULTS: Median follow-up was 41.8 months with 2193 reported deaths. The 3-year OS was 67.5% for surgery + adjuvant RT and 70.5% for surgery + adjuvant CRT (P = .013). For negative margins, the corresponding 3-year OS was 70.1% and 74.9% (P = .005). For positive margins, the corresponding 3-year OS was 56.0% and 60.6% (P = .079). On multivariate analysis, the beneficial effect for adjuvant CRT over adjuvant RT was not significant (HR 0.90; CI 0.79-1.03; P = .124)., CONCLUSION: In this cohort of patients with T4N0 HNSCC treated with surgery, there was no observed survival benefit of adjuvant CRT over adjuvant RT on multivariate analysis.

N2  - Early oral cancer is preferably treated by surgery. Its complete removal is essential for locoregional control and disease-free survival. Inadequate resection margins require adjuvant therapy such as re-resection or (chemo)radiation, that causes extra morbidity and oral discomfort. Intraoral ultrasonography (US) is reported to be of value in determining tumor thickness. Intraoperative visualization of the tumor may facilitate the resection and ensure adequate surgical margins. Furthermore, accurate prediction of tumor thickness could help determine the treatment strategy of the clinically node-negative neck, as thickness and depth of invasion are predictors of cervical metastasis as well as prognosticators of survival. The 8th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system for oral squamous cell carcinoma has included depth of invasion as parameter for cT-stage. The aim of this review is to analyze the accuracy of intraoral US in determining tumor thickness in oral cancer. A systematic search was conducted, and the quality of the included papers was assessed using the QUADAS-2 tool for diagnostic accuracy studies. Subsequently, a meta-analysis was performed on the available individual participant data of 240 patients. Most of the twelve included studies focused on T1-2 tongue cancer (n=129). Meta-analysis showed a high correlation in tumor thickness within this subgroup as measured by intraoral US and histopathology (r=0.82, p<.001), with minor overestimation of 0.5mm on US. It is concluded that intraoral US is very accurate in determining tumor thickness in early oral tongue cancer. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The surgeon's evaluation of resection status based on frozen section analysis during operation and pathological examination of resected specimens often differ. For this study, we recapitulated the surgeon's perspective during an operation, accordingly classified the evaluation of margins by the surgeon, and analyzed its impact on the outcome compared with the pathological results., METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis. As data sources, paper-based and digital patient files, as well as the Munich Cancer Registry database were used., RESULTS: Three hundred ninety-six cases were included in this analysis. Only the evaluation of margins by the surgeon influenced local control, and the pathological results influenced disease-free survival (DFS). Surprisingly, margins of >5 mm of normal tissue to cancer growth led to local control and overall survival (OS) significantly worse than 1 to 5-mm resections., CONCLUSION: The evaluation of margins by the surgeon is of significant importance for local control and OS. It is largely based on frozen section analysis, which, therefore, should be used whenever possible. Copyright © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - BACKGROUND: A histological, tumour-free surgical margin does not guarantee recurrence-free survival in patients with cancer. This study investigated the association between microsatellite alteration in tumour-free surgical margins and local recurrence in patients with oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma., METHODS: Patients with histologically confirmed oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma were enrolled in this prospective study. Cancerous specimens, corresponding surgical margins and peripheral blood were obtained. Microsatellite alteration was investigated using six dinucleotide microsatellite markers. All samples were amplified by PCR, followed by automatic fragment analysis., RESULTS: Microsatellite alteration was identified in 100 specimens (69.0 per cent) from 145 patients. Among them, 85 specimens carried loss of heterozygosity, whereas 55 had microsatellite instability (MSI). Patients with MSI at the surgical margin had a higher risk of local recurrence on multivariable analysis (odds ratio 7.17, 95 per cent c.i. 3.49 to 14.73)., CONCLUSION: Molecular assessment of surgical margins can help identify patients at risk of local recurrence.

N2  - Objectives To investigate the clinical predictors and survival implications of perineural invasion (PNI) in parotid gland malignancies. Study Design Case series with chart review. Setting Tertiary care medical center. Subjects and Methods Patients with parotid gland malignancies treated surgically from 2000 to 2015 were retrospectively identified in the Head and Neck Cancer Registry at a single institution. Data points were extracted from the medical record and original pathology reports. Results In total, 186 patients with parotid gland malignancies were identified with a mean follow-up of 5.2 years. Salivary duct carcinoma (45), mucoepidermoid carcinoma (44), and acinic cell carcinoma (26) were the most common histologic types. A total of 46.2% of tumors were found to have PNI. At the time of presentation, facial nerve paresis (odds ratio [OR], 64.7; P < .001) and facial pain (OR, 3.7; P = .002) but not facial paresthesia or anesthesia (OR, 2.8, P = .085) were predictive of PNI. Malignancies with PNI were significantly more likely to be of advanced T and N classification, be high-risk pathologic types, and have positive margins and angiolymphatic invasion. PNI positivity was associated with worse overall (hazard ratio, 2.62; P = .001) and disease-free survival (4.18; P < .001) on univariate Cox regression analysis. However, when controlling for other negative prognosticators, age, and adjuvant therapy, PNI did not have a statistically significant effect on disease-free or overall survival. Conclusions PNI is strongly correlated with more aggressive parotid gland malignancies but is not an independent predictor of worse survival. Facial paresis and pain were predictive of PNI positivity, and facial paresis correlated with worse overall and disease-free survival.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), the catalytic subunit of the polycomb repressive complex 2, plays an important role in tumor development and progression by interacting with histone and non-histone proteins. EZH2 represents a putative therapeutic target and has been suggested as a prognostic marker in several cancer types., MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study investigates the prognostic relevance of immunohistochemical EZH2 expression in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Tissue microarray sections with 667 cancers of oral cavity, oro- and hypopharynx and larynx were analyzed for EZH2 expression., RESULTS: Nuclear EZH2 staining was recorded in 322 (81.8%) of 394 cases. Staining was weak in 33 (10.2%), moderate in 128 (39.6%), and strong in 103 (32.0%) cancers. The prevalence of EZH2 expression in tumors of the oral cavity and the orohypopharynx was higher as compared to cancers of the larynx (P = .0023). EZH2 expression was correlated to presence of lymph node metastasis (P = .0089) but was unrelated to histological grade, tumor stage, surgical margin, or distant metastasis. EZH2 expression had no impact on patient survival., CONCLUSION: The high prevalence of EZH2 expression in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma stresses its capability as a therapeutic target.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Tumor volume in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) was mainly measured in nonsurgically treated patients. We analyzed the influence of tumor volume on complete response (CR), overall survival (OS), and clear surgical margins also in primarily surgically treated patients., METHODS: In contrast-enhanced CTs, the tumor volumes of patients with incident HNSCC were measured., RESULTS: The tumor volumes of 259 patients were measured, of which 125 patients (48%) underwent primary surgery and 102 patients (84%) had clear margins. The tumor volume was not an independent factor for CR at the primary tumor site. Risk of death increased by 1.4% per mL of tumor volume (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.8%-2.0%; P < .001). The OS was better in patients treated with primary surgery, if the tumor volume was <=12 mL (P < .001). Risk of involved margins increased by 4.5% per mL of tumor volume (95% CI 0.9%-8.3%; P = .003). The predicted probability of clear margins was >=80% in tumor volumes <= 16 mL., CONCLUSION: The tumor volume had an impact on CR, OS, and clear margins. The tumor volume may also aid in selecting HNSCC treatment. Copyright © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - Objective To analyze the patterns of care and survival for pT1-2N1M0 head and neck cancer based on receipt of surgery alone, surgery + postoperative radiotherapy (S + RT), or surgery + postoperative chemoradiotherapy (S + CRT). Study Design Retrospective analysis. Setting National Cancer Database. Subjects and Methods We queried the database for patients with stage pT1-2N1M0 squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, or larynx between 2004 and 2012 who were treated with surgery with negative margins and no extracapsular extension. Logistic regression was used to assess predictors of receipt of postoperative treatment. Overall survival was assessed by the Kaplan-Meier method, and Cox regression analysis identified covariates that affected it. Results There were 1598 patients included in this study: 566 (35.4%) received surgery alone; 726 (45.4%), S + RT; and 306 (19.1%), S + CRT. The 5-year overall survival was 68.8%, 74.0%, and 87.8%, respectively ( P = .009 comparing S + RT and surgery alone, P < .001 for all other comparisons). On multivariable logistic regression, academic centers were associated with a decreased likelihood of S + RT (odds ratio = 0.71) and S + CRT (odds ratio = 0.66). Multivariable Cox regression demonstrated no difference in survival for S + RT over surgery alone (hazard ratio = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.70-1.09, P = .24); however, there was a survival benefit associated with S + CRT (hazard ratio = 0.57, 95% CI = 0.39-0.81, P = .002). Conclusion Nearly 65% of patients with pT1-2N1 head and neck cancer with negative margins and no extracapsular extension received S + RT or S + CRT. Improvement in survival was noted only for patients who received S + CRT.

N2  - Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the sixth most common cancer worldwide, and is associated with poor prognosis. Autophagy is a programmed cell survival mechanism involved in physiologic processes and various diseases including cancer. However, the relationship between autophagy and cancer is controversial. Several studies have claimed that the expression of autophagy-related proteins, namely microtubule-associated protein light chain3 (LC3) and p62/SQSTM1 (p62), is associated with poor prognosis in OSCC. In this study, we evaluated the expression of the autophagy-related markers LC3A/B and p62 by immunohistochemistry in 71 OSCC patient samples, especially focusing on surgical margins. Results were correlated with clinical characteristics. The expression of LC3A and LC3B was correlated with tumor recurrence and poor overall survival based on multivariate analysis, whereas the expression of p62 was correlated with only tumor recurrence and not prognosis. Thus, we suggest that the expression of autophagy-related markers at the surgical margins might be an indicator of local recurrence and poor prognosis in human OSCC. These results will aid in the development of new therapeutics and diagnostics for OSCC. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Primary surgery is the preferred treatment of T1-T4a sinonasal squamous cell carcinoma (SNSCC)., METHODS: Patients with SNSCC in the National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) were analyzed. Factors that contributed to selecting primary surgical treatment were examined. Overall survival (OS) in surgical patients was analyzed., RESULTS: Four-thousand seven hundred and seventy patients with SNSCC were included. In T1-T4a tumors, lymph node metastases, maxillary sinus location, and treatment at high-volume centers were associated with selecting primary surgery. When primary surgery was utilized, tumor factors and positive margin guided worse OS. Adjuvant therapy improved OS in positive margin resection and advanced T stage cases., CONCLUSIONS: Tumor and non-tumor factors are associated with selecting surgery for the treatment of SNSCC. When surgery is selected, tumor factors drive OS. Negative margin resection should be the goal of a primary surgical approach. When a positive margin resection ensues, adjuvant therapy may improve OS. Copyright © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - Today, most head and neck cancer subsites, such as the larynx, hypopharynx, nasopharynx, and oropharynx, are treated with radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy as a primary treatment modality. Surgery is reserved for the salvage of recurrent tumors that occur within the head and neck in the absence of distant (ie, lung, liver) metastasis. However, unlike all other head and neck subsites, oral cancer should ideally be managed with primary surgery with the possibility of adjuvant radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy depending on the presence of certain high-risk pathologic features.

N2  - The purpose of this proof-of-principle study was to develop a rapid and approachable method to analyse bone resection margins in patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) in an intraoperative setting, similar to assessing frozen sections of soft tissue. Bone excision and risk of remaining tumour cells could be minimised, thus improving reconstruction measures and facilitating convalescence. Frozen, sawed wafers of porcine bone artificially combined with porcine skin (simulating OSCC properties) were used to develop and evaluate a new molecular method: protein transfer from non-decalcified, sawed wafers onto a membrane stained by immunofluorescence (Tissue-ProtTrans). Tissue-ProtTrans was based on the detection of keratin 5/6 as a marker of tumour cells. The results were compared to standard immunohistochemistry (IHC) and H&E results of the same wafers after decalcification. Tissue-ProtTrans resulted in a total assay time of 3.5 h using the Trans-Blot R Turbo TM Transfer System (Bio-Rad) for protein transfer. Amersham Protran R Premium Nitrocellulose Membranes 0.2 microm (GE Healthcare) were stained with a primary antibody to keratin 5/6 (Dako Agilent) and a secondary antibody labelled with IRDye R 800CW (LI-COR). Visualisation was performed with an infrared laser scanner (Odyssey). Upon comparison, five independent experiments on porcine specimens processed with the Tissue-ProtTrans showed similar results to standard IHC and H&E analysis. In comparison to standard IHC results (requiring several days due to decalcification) Tissue-ProtTrans provided similar results, but was much faster (3.5 h). This highly promising method has good potential for further time reduction and will be suitable for intraoperative assessment.

N2  - Frozen section is routinely used for intraoperative margin evaluation in carcinomas of the head and neck. We studied a series of frozen sections performed for margin status of head and neck tumors to determine diagnostic accuracy. All frozen sections for margin control of squamous carcinomas of the head and neck were studied from a 66 month period. Frozen and permanent section diagnoses were classified as negative or malignant. Correlation of diagnoses was performed to determine accuracy. One thousand seven hundred and ninety-six pairs of frozen section and corresponding permanent section diagnoses were obtained. Discordances were found in 55 (3.1%) pairs. In 35 pairs (1.9%), frozen section was reported as benign, but permanent sections disclosed carcinoma. In 21 cases, the discrepancy was due to sampling and in the remaining cases it was an interpretive error. In 20 cases (1.1%), frozen section was malignant, but the permanent section was interpreted as negative. Frozen section is an accurate method for evaluation of operative margins for head and neck carcinomas with concordance between frozen and permanent results of 97%. Most errors are false negative results with the majority of these being due to sampling issues.

N2  - OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Randomized trials have demonstrated that adjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) confers an overall survival (OS) benefit over adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) alone in patients with resected head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) with adverse pathologic features (positive surgical margins [SM+] and/or extracapsular extension [ECE]). Whether this OS benefit exists in an elderly population remains unknown., STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective database study., METHODS: Using the National Cancer Database, we identified 1,686 elderly patients (age >=70 years) with resected HNSCC with SM+ and/or ECE, who received adjuvant CRT (491 patients, 29%) or adjuvant RT alone (1,195 patients, 71%) between 1998 and 2011. Three-year survival rates were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method both before and after propensity score matching (PSM). Crude and adjusted hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were computed using Cox regression modeling., RESULTS: Median follow-up was 23.5 and 42.8 months for all and surviving patients, respectively. Three-year OS was 50.7% and 44.4% among patients receiving adjuvant CRT and RT alone, respectively (P = .002). On multivariate analysis, there was no significant improvement in OS with adjuvant CRT relative to adjuvant RT alone (HR: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.73-1.06). Similarly, a PSM cohort showed no significant difference in the 3-year OS for patients receiving adjuvant CRT versus adjuvant RT alone (48.8% and 50.9%, respectively; P = .839)., CONCLUSIONS: Although the addition of chemotherapy to adjuvant RT has been proven effective in randomized trials of patients with resected HNSCC with SM+ or ECE, it may be less efficacious in an elderly patient population treated outside of a controlled trial setting., LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 2c.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: In case of close or positive resection margins after oncological resection in head and neck surgery, additional treatment is necessary. When conventional options are exhausted, photodynamic therapy (PDT) can play a role in achieving clear margins. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the clinical benefit of PDT as adjuvant therapy next to surgery with positive resection margins. The role of the time interval between surgery and PDT on survival outcomes also was investigated., STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort analysis., METHODS: Adjuvant PDT was performed in patients with a malignancy in the head and neck region with close or positive resection margins who were not eligible for conventional treatment options. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival. Secondary endpoints were disease-free survival, overall survival, and optimal time interval between surgery and PDT., RESULTS: Fifty-four patients were treated with surgery followed by meta-tetrahydroxyphenylchlorin-mediated PDT. There was a large diversity in tumor location and histopathology, as well as in time interval between surgery and PDT. The 2-year progression-free survival rate was 30%; 2-year disease-free survival rate was 28%; and 2-year overall survival was 51%. Disease-free survival was significantly better when the time interval between surgery and PDT was >= 6 weeks (P = 0.02)., CONCLUSION: PDT can be applied as adjuvant therapy after surgery in cases of a malignancy with close or positive tumor resection margins. However, the clinical benefits are yet to be determined. There is a significantly better disease-free survival with a time interval between surgery and PDT of minimal 6 weeks., LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4.

N2  - PURPOSE: Keratinization is a routinely reported histologic feature in head and neck cancer. In contrast to numerous clinicopathologic parameters, the prognostic value of keratinization in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is rarely reported in the literature. The purpose of this study was to review the outcome of patients with OSCC with a special focus on the degree of keratinization., PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we evaluated the medical records at the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Jena University Hospital, and investigated the outcome of patients with OSCC with disease-free survival and disease-specific survival according to the degree of keratinization. This research also analyzed common clinical and histologic parameters such as age, gender, tumor site, T category, N category, resection margin, lymphovascular invasion, and extracapsular spread. Descriptive statistics were performed, and survival was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Prognostic factors were analyzed by multivariate Cox analysis., RESULTS: In the sample of 151 OSCC patients, with a median age of 57.5 years and a male-female ratio of 4.03:1, 119 had tumors with no or low keratinization (K0 to K2) and 32 had tumors with good or high keratinization (K3 or K4). More recurrences were seen in patients with OSCC with low keratinization (P = .0008). The 5-year disease-free survival rate was significantly decreased for OSCC with low keratinization (52.9%) compared with good or high keratinization (93.2%) (P = .0008). The 5-year disease-specific survival rate was reduced to 66.1% (P = .0136) for patients with OSCC with low keratinization. Multivariate analysis showed that extracapsular spread (P = .001) and keratinization (P = .002) are independent, significant prognostic factors for recurrence in OSCC., CONCLUSIONS: Besides extracapsular spread, the degree of keratinization seems to be an important prognostic factor for recurrence and survival in OSCC. Our results indicate that the degree of keratinization should be considered in decisions regarding treatment and prognosis for OSCC.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Transoral robotic surgery (TORS) is now a well-validated technique for resection of head and neck cancers. Benefits include reduced patient morbidity, swallowing preservation and rationalization of adjuvant therapies., METHODS: This was a single-centre, retrospective review of 35 patients who underwent TORS of oro-, retro- and parapharyngeal tumours between March 2014 and August 2015. Outcome measures included resection margins, swallowing function and impact on post-operative radiotherapy., RESULTS: Median age was 63.7 years and the number of male patients was 22 (62.9%). Tongue base was the most common site (51.4%), followed by tonsil (25.7%). Nine patients (25.7%) had previous radiotherapy. A total of 24 patients had squamous cell carcinoma and the clear margin rate for primary TORS was 93.3%. Median hospital stay was 5.5 days, longer for previously irradiated patients (9 days). Median nasogastric tube dependence was 3.5 days. Four patients (11.4%) received a gastrostomy and two patients remained dependent on the tube at the time of last review. There were two major complications (5.7%): bleeding requiring return to theatre (1) and pulmonary embolism (1). Post-operative radiotherapy was either avoided or reduced in 22 patients (81.5%)., CONCLUSION: TORS is a safe and effective tool, providing surgical access to oropharyngeal and other difficult to access areas. Patient selection and a multidisciplinary approach are essential to ensure adequate margins can be achieved and therefore to reduce adjuvant therapies.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Surgical treatment of maxillary tumours is often highly complex. The three-dimensional anatomy of the mid-face renders both correct intraoperative orientation and adequate oncological safety difficult to obtain. Recently, computer-assisted techniques and intraoperative navigation have been applied to oncological surgery treating head and neck cancer. However, only a few studies have explored whether preoperative virtual resection planning and intraoperative control of resection margins allow assessment of the surgical margins of the tumour. In our present feasibility study, we developed a protocol for preoperative mapping of tumour margins using computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging, virtual planning of the surgical resection, and intraoperative navigation during actual resection of advanced maxillary tumours., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty patients were included in this feasibility study. We prospectively selected ten patients requiring surgery to treat malignant maxillary tumours. A control group of ten patients was retrospectively selected. The simulation protocol featured the following steps: 1. "Contouring" of the tumour: identification of the tumour and the borders thereof on the axial, sagittal, and coronal planes; 2. Definition of the resection margins by positioning "landmarks" at least 1 cm from the tumour edges on the axial, sagittal, and coronal planes; 3. Simulation of osteotomy lines passing through the landmarks, and evaluation of the bony defects to be reconstructed. Tumour margins were controlled by using a pointer to identify mobilised regions and then checking the overlap between the planned resection (shown on the LCD screen of the navigation system) and the real anatomical situation., RESULTS: A total of 127 margins were pathologically assessed in the test group, and 85 were assessed in the control group. Overall, 9% of surgical margins were positive in the test group, and 16% were positive in the control group (p = 0.0047). A significant difference was apparent in terms of deep margin evaluation: in test patients, 87% of margins were clear; this figure was 75% for the control group (p = 0.0038). No significant difference in either mucosal or bone margin clearance was evident. The preoperative planning errors were <5 mm for 91% of all planned resection margins., CONCLUSION: The navigation-guided resection protocol seems to improve tumour-free margin status in patients with advanced maxillary tumours. Further confirmatory trial, enrolling a larger cohort of patients, is needed to strengthen these preliminary results and advantages of this procedure.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Treatment failure and poor 5-year survival in mucosal head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) has remained unchanged for decades mainly due to advanced stage of presentation and high rates of recurrence. Incomplete surgical removal of the tumour, attributed to lack of reliable methods to delineate the surgical margins, is a major cause of disease recurrence. The predictability of recurrence using immunohistochemistry (IHC) to delineate surgical margins (PRISM) in mucosal HNSCC study aims to redefine margin status by identifying the true extent of the tumour at the molecular level by performing IHC with molecular markers, eukaryotic initiation factor, eIF4Eand tumour suppressor gene, p53, on the surgical margins and test the use of Lugol's iodine and fluorescence visualisation prior to the wide local excision. This article describes the study protocol at its pre - results stage., METHODS AND ANALYSIS: PRISM-HNSCC is a bilateral observational research being conducted in Darwin, Australia and Vellore, India. Individuals diagnosed with HNSCC will undergo the routine wide local excision of the tumour followed by histopathological assessment. Tumours with clear surgical margins that satisfy the exclusion criteria will be selected for further staining of the margins with eIF4E and p53 antibodies. Results of IHC staining will be correlated with recurrences in an attempt to predict the risk of disease recurrence. Patients in Darwin will undergo intraoperative staining of the lesion with Lugol's iodine and fluorescence visualisation to delineate the excision margins while patients in Vellore will not undertake these tests. The outcomes will be analysed., ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The PRISM-HNSCC study was approved by the institutional ethics committees in Darwin (Human Research Ethics Committee 13-2036) and Vellore (Institutional Review Board Min. no. 8967). Outcomes will be disseminated through publications in academic journals and presentations at educational meetings and conferences. It will be presented as dissertation at the Charles Darwin University. We will communicate the study results to both participating sites. Participating sites will communicate results with patients who have indicated an interest in knowing the results., TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12616000715471).

N2  - PURPOSE: To present the long-term and final report of a phase 3 trial designed to assess dose-response relationship for postoperative radiation therapy (PORT) and pathologic risk groups in head and neck cancer., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients who underwent primary surgery for American Joint Committee on Cancer stage III or IV squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, or larynx and who required PORT were eligible. Patients' primary sites and involved necks were independently assigned to higher- or lower-risk categories based on a cumulative point score representing increasing risk of recurrence. The sites in the lower-risk group were randomized to receive 57.6 or 63 Gy and those in the higher-risk group were randomized to receive 63 or 68.4 Gy, all at 1.8 Gy per fraction., RESULTS: A total of 264 patients were included. The actuarial 5-year locoregional control rate was 67%. A second primary cancer was documented in 27% of patients. The 5- and 10-year freedom-from-distant metastasis rates were 64% and 60%, respectively, whereas the 5- and 10-year overall survival rates were 32% and 20%, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in tumor control between different dose levels in both the lower- and higher-risk groups. On multivariate analysis, nonwhite race (P=.0003), positive surgical margins (P=.009), extracapsular extension (ECE, P=.01), and treatment package time (TPT) >=85 days (P=.002) were independent correlates of worse locoregional control, whereas age >=57 years (P<.0001), positive surgical margins (P=.01), ECE (P=.026), and TPT >=85 days (P=.003) were independently associated with worse overall survival., CONCLUSIONS: This long-term report of PORT delivered at 1.8 Gy/d to total doses of 57.6 to 68.4 Gy without chemotherapy for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma demonstrated that increasing dose did not significantly improve tumor control. On multivariate analysis, the only significant treatment variable was TPT. The results confirm that positive surgical margins and/or nodal ECE remains the most significant predictive pathologic factors. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

T1  - Margin Analysis-Has Free Tissue Transfer Improved Oncologic Outcomes for Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma?.
A1  - Edwards, Sean P
Y1  - 2017//
N2  - Microvascular reconstruction of ablative defects has become a mainstay of contemporary management of head and neck cancer patients. These techniques offer myriad tissue options that vary in character, volume, and components and have vastly improved the esthetic and functional outcomes achieved in this patient population. Although consensus exists regarding the reliability and functional and esthetic benefits of free tissue transfer, the same cannot be said for oncologic outcomes. The increase in resources required for the routine use of free tissue transfer has led to asking this question-Do vascularized free flaps allow for increased surgical margins and improvements in oncologic outcomes?

N2  - BACKGROUND: betaIII-tubulin (TUBB3) is an isotype of microtubules, which are involved in crucial cellular roles including maintenance of cell shape, intracellular transport, and mitosis. Overexpression of TUBB3 was found to be associated with poor prognosis and resistance to tubulin-binding drugs and in several solid tumors including head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC). Considering the potential high importance of a prognostic biomarker in these cancers, this study aimed to investigate the clinical relevance of immunohistochemical TUBB3 expression in HNSCC., METHODS: Tissue microarray (TMA) sections containing samples from 667 cancers of oral cavity, oro- and hypopharynx, and larynx for which follow-up data were available were analyzed for TUBB3 expression by immunohistochemistry., RESULTS: Over 90% of our analyzed cancers showed unequivocal cytoplasmic TUBB3 expression. Staining was considered weak in 69 (15.5%), moderate in 149 (33.5%), and strong in 188 (42.2%) of cancers. The frequent TUBB3 overexpression showed no significant correlation with pathological grading, tumor stage, nodal status, or surgical margin and had no impact on patient outcomes., CONCLUSION: Despite lacking prognostic utility in HNSCC, the remarkable high prevalence of TUBB3 expression in HNSCC emphasizes its putative relevance as a target for future drugs targeting TUBB3.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Currently, positive surgical margins in head and neck cancer are considered to be an indicator for postoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT) over radiotherapy (RT) alone. However, there are less data regarding the impact of margin status on human papillomavirus (HPV)-related oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)., METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of 55 patients with oropharyngeal SCC undergoing primary surgical treatment. The impact of margin status on disease-specific survival (DSS) was studied according to p16 status., RESULTS: Twenty-one patients had positive margins. Adjuvant treatment in these cases was CRT (n = 6), RT alone (n = 14), and none (n = 1). Among p16-negative patients, positive margins and dysplasia at margins predicted significantly worse DSS. Among patients with p16-positive disease, margin status had no impact on DSS., CONCLUSION: Patients with p16-positive oropharyngeal SCC and positive margins after excision maintain a low risk of recurrence despite most receiving RT alone as adjuvant treatment. These findings raise questions regarding the additional benefit of postoperative CRT in this group. Copyright © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - The aim our study was to determine the accuracy of frozen sections in oral cancer resections. Patients who underwent oral cancer resection at Patel Hospital were included in the study. Tissues for frozen sections were obtained from the mucosal margins and tumour bed. Frozen sections were compared with the paraffin embedded sections which served as the gold standard in our study. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, accuracy and kappa statistics were calculated. A total of 299 frozen sections were obtained from 77 patients who underwent oral cancer resection, mean (3.88+/-0.76). Frozen sections' sensitivity in relation to permanent sections was 72.7% and specificity of 93.9%. The overall accuracy of the test was 90.9%. Kappa value was calculated to be 0.642, which showed a moderate agreement. Frozen sections are accurate enough to be used in assessing intraoperative margin assessment for tumour clearance.

N2  - Purpose To examine recent utilization and survival outcomes associated with use of adjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) for patients with resected locally advanced head and neck cancer (LAHNC) with negative surgical margins (SM negative) and no extracapsular extension (ECE). Materials and Methods We conducted a retrospective observational cohort study using the National Cancer Database evaluating patients diagnosed in 2004 to 2012 with AJCC stage III to IVB squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, and larynx treated with definitive surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) or CRT. We identified a subset of patients with SM negative and no ECE (n = 10,870). We determined factors associated with CRT use and examined overall survival of patients receiving CRT versus RT. We further evaluated survival outcomes by number of lymph nodes involved to assess whether this was associated with benefit from CRT. Results Among patients with resected LAHNC with SM negative and no ECE, 47% received adjuvant CRT. The use of CRT varied substantially according to several factors, including patient age, contralateral/bulky neck disease, increasing number of positive lymph nodes, and lower neck disease. CRT was associated with a statistically significant improvement in overall survival compared with RT alone (hazard ratio, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.86 to 0.94; P < .001). Survival benefits of CRT versus RT alone increased in patients with multiple positive lymph nodes. Conclusion The use of adjuvant CRT in patients with resected LAHNC with SM negative and no ECE is common. Substantial practice variation as well as the survival differences observed in this study support the conduct of additional research to guide personalized treatment approaches in this setting. The number of positive lymph nodes seems to be an appropriate selection factor for further investigation of CRT in such patients.

N2  - Oral cavity cancer belongs to head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma group. The purpose of the study was to assess the levels of certain proteins in a tumour and surgical margin in a group of patients with oral cavity cancer. The levels of DAPK1, MGMT, CDH1, SFRP1, SFRP2, RORA, TIMP3, p16, APC and RASSF1 proteins were measured by ELISA in tissue homogenates. The protein levels of DAPK1, MGMT, CDH1, SFRP2 and RASSF1 were significantly higher in tumour tissue than in the margin, contrary to TIMP3 which was lower in the tumour itself. DAPK1 level in the tumour was significantly higher in females than in males, the MGMT and p16 levels were lower in the tumours with lymph node metastasis (N1 + N2) than in N0 samples. The CDH1 expression was higher in a group with smoking habits, whereas TIMP3 was lower in this group. Changes in the levels of proteins in tumour and surgical margin may be either reflective of tumour occurrence and development, or they might be also responsible for the progress and reoccurrence of the disease. Levels of the studied proteins might be good prognostic factors; however, further studies are required.

N2  - Objective To describe histologic subtypes and oncologic outcomes among patients with radiation-induced and de novo sarcomas of the head and neck. Study Design Retrospective case series with chart review. Setting Tertiary academic center. Subject and Methods In total, 166 adult patients with sarcoma of the head and neck treated from January 1, 1985, to January 1, 2010, were included. Tumors were characterized as radiation induced (15.1%) vs de novo sarcomas (84.9%). Clinical and tumor characteristics were compared. The primary outcomes were overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS). Results Radiation-induced sarcomas were more likely to be high grade ( P = .006) and advanced stage ( P = .03). Chondrosarcoma was more common in de novo tumors ( P = .02) while leiomyosarcoma ( P = .01), sarcoma not otherwise specified ( P = .02), and undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma ( P < .001) were more common in radiation-induced sarcomas. Radiation-induced sarcomas were associated with statistically significantly worse DSS ( P = .019) and OS ( P = .005) compared with de novo sarcomas, but when only high-grade soft tissue sarcomas were analyzed, neither DSS ( P = .48) nor OS ( P = .29) differed. Margin status was a significant predictor of survival as both R0 and R1 resections correlated with statistically better DSS and OS compared with R2 ( P < .001) resections and patients treated with radiation therapy/chemoradiation therapy alone ( P = .005). Conclusion Radiation-induced sarcomas of the head and neck correlate with worse survival compared with de novo tumors; however, when controlling for tumor grade and resection status, there is no statistically significant difference in observed outcomes.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Sinonasal malignancies are a rare and heterogeneous group of tumors for which there is a paucity of robust data with which to guide management decisions. The authors used the National Cancer Data Base to better understand the presenting characteristics of these tumors and to compare outcomes by treatment modality., METHODS: The National Cancer Data Base was queried for sinonasal malignancies diagnosed between 2004 and 2012. Overall survival was assessed using multivariate analyses and propensity score matching., RESULTS: A total of 11,160 patients were identified for the initial analysis. The majority were male, aged 40 to 69 years, with tumors of the nasal cavity or maxillary sinus. Squamous cell histology was most common. The majority of patients presented with advanced tumor stage but without locoregional lymph node or distant metastases. Treatment modalities were compared for squamous cell carcinomas. In multivariate analysis, compared with surgery alone, patients who received adjuvant radiotherapy (hazard ratio [HR], 0.658 [P<.001]), adjuvant chemoradiotherapy (HR, 0.696 [P = .002]), or neoadjuvant therapy (HR, 0.656 [P = .007]) had improved overall survival. Patients who received radiotherapy alone (HR, 1.294 [P = .001]) or chemotherapy alone (HR, 1.834 [P<.001]) had worse outcomes. These findings were validated in propensity score matching. It is important to note that neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy was associated with achieving a negative surgical margin (odds ratio, 2.641 [P = .045])., CONCLUSIONS: Surgery is the mainstay of therapy for patients with sinonasal malignancies, but multimodality therapy is associated with improved overall survival.

N2  - The intraoperative cytological assessment of bony resection margins (ICAB) is a feasible diagnostic approach to support frozen section for assessment of invasion of margins of soft and hard tissue. However, complex resection margins could challenge both diagnostic approaches. Our objective here was to identify the limitations of intraoperative diagnostic methods for assessing margins. We present an advanced cytological approach to assess complex margins that may solve the problem. Data from 119 patients in whom frozen section was supported by ICAB, were reviewed and the reasons for false results analysed. In 35 patients with squamous cell carcinoma infiltrating bone, specimens (n=100) from the resection margin went through an intraoperative cell isolation process for the cytological assessment of bony margins (ICAB). The results were compared with the histological results of the corresponding margins of bone as a reference. Limitations to the assessment of operative bony margins intraoperatively included an infiltrative histological pattern of growth of the carcinoma, with carcinoma cells disseminated within the cancellous bone, complex and uneven resection margins with soft and bony tissue, inflammation, and signs of previous radiotherapy. Intraoperative cell isolation plus (ICICAB) allowed the microscopic assessment of up to 1cm3 of bony tissue to detect disseminated carcinoma cells within the cancellous bone with a sensitivity of 92.3% (95% CI 74.9% to 99.1%), and a specificity of 100% (95% CI 95.1% to 100%), and positive and negative predictive values of 100% (95% CI 85.8% to 100%) and 97.4% (95%CI 90.8% to 99.7%), respectively. Intraoperative cell isolation is a feasible new technique to support ICAB and frozen section in the assessment of bony and soft tissue margins.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The mainstay of treatment in adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) of the head and neck is surgical resection with negative margins. The purpose of this study was to define the margin status that associates with survival outcomes of ACC of the head and neck., METHODS: We conducted univariate and multivariate analyses of international data., RESULTS: Data of 507 patients with ACC of the head and neck were analyzed; negative margins defined as >=5 mm were detected in 253 patients (50%). On multivariate analysis, the hazard ratios (HRs) of positive margin status were 2.68 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-6.2; p = .04) and 2.63 (95% CI, 1.1-6.3; p = .03) for overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS), respectively. Close margins had no significant impact on outcome, with HRs of 1.1 (95% CI, 0.4-3.0; p = .12) and 1.07 (95% CI, 0.3-3.4; p = .23) for OS and DSS, respectively, relative with negative margins., CONCLUSION: In head and neck ACC, positive margins are associated with the worst outcome. Negative or close margins are associated with improved outcome, regardless of the distance from the tumor. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Head Neck 39: 1008-1014, 2017.

N2  - BACKGROUND: We investigated in a prospective cohort of patients treated with trans-oral robotic surgery (TORS) for oropharyngeal cancer (OPC), who were selected for the absence of radiographic extra-capsular extension (ECS) and surgically revised for inadequate margins, the possibility of reducing adjuvant radiation (RT)/chemo-radiation therapy (CRT) without jeopardizing tumor control and functional outcome., METHODS: We conducted a prospective observational cohort of patients treated with TORS for oropharyngeal cancer., RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients with T1/2N0 to N2B stage cancers were treated with TORS. Forty-five percent of them were treated for secondary primaries. Nine of 29 patients (31%) were revised for close/positive margins. Adjuvant RT was prescribed for 2 of 19 patients with early squamous cell carcinoma (SCCs) and CRT for 1 of 10 patients with advanced oropharyngeal SCCs. Overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), and locoregional control at 2 years were 85%, 96%, and 93%, respectively. Posttreatment Functional Outcome Swallowing Scale (FOSS) scores worsened with prior or adjuvant RT, local recurrence, site, and revision for margins., CONCLUSION: Patients with early and moderately advanced oropharyngeal SCC selected for radiographic ECS and revised for inadequate margins have excellent tumor control and favorable functional recovery. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - PURPOSE: Purpose of this feasibility study was (1) to evaluate whether application of ex-vivo 7T MR of the resected tongue specimen containing squamous cell carcinoma may provide information on the resection margin status and (2) to evaluate the research and developmental issues that have to be solved for this technique to have the beneficial impact on clinical outcome that we expect: better oncologic and functional outcomes, better quality of life, and lower costs., METHODS: We performed a non-blinded validation of ex-vivo 7T MR to detect the tongue squamous cell carcinoma and resection margin in 10 fresh tongue specimens using histopathology as gold standard., RESULTS: In six of seven specimens with a histopathologically determined invasion depth of the tumor of [Formula: see text] mm, the tumor could be recognized on MR, with a resection margin within a 2 mm range as compared to histopathology. In three specimens with an invasion depth of [Formula: see text] mm, the tumor was not visible on MR. Technical limitations mainly included scan time, image resolution, and the fact that we used a less available small-bore 7T MR machine., CONCLUSION: Ex-vivo 7T probably will have a low negative predictive value but a high positive predictive value, meaning that in tumors thicker than a few millimeters we expect to be able to predict whether the resection margin is too small. A randomized controlled trial needs to be performed to show our hypothesis: better oncologic and functional outcomes, better quality of life, and lower costs.

N2  - OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: The diagnostic gain of narrow band imaging in the definition of surgical margins in the treatment of head and neck cancer was evaluated., STUDY DESIGN: A prospective study, blinded to the pathologist, with historical comparison., METHODS: The study group included 45 patients subjected to the intraoperative definition of margins by narrow band imaging. The control group included 55 patients who had undergone standard definition of margins. All patients underwent resection of the tumor and frozen section analysis of superficial margins. The rate of initial R0 resection and the ratio of histologically negative margins for both groups were statistically compared., RESULTS: The rate of initial R0 resection in the study group and in the control group was 88.9% and 70.9% (P = .047), and the ratio of histologically negative margins was 95.9% and 88.4% (P = .017), respectively., CONCLUSIONS: Narrow band imaging reveals a microscopic extension of the tumor that could be effectively used to better define superficial margins and to achieve a higher rate of initial R0 resections., LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4 Laryngoscope, 127:1577-1582, 2017.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to assess the potential of U.S. Food and Drug Administration-cleared devices designed for indocyanine green-based perfusion imaging to identify cancer-specific bioconjugates with overlapping excitation and emission wavelengths. Recent clinical trials have demonstrated potential for fluorescence-guided surgery, but the time and cost of the approval process may impede clinical translation. To expedite this translation, we explored the feasibility of repurposing existing optical imaging devices for fluorescence-guided surgery., METHODS: Consenting patients (n = 15) scheduled for curative resection were enrolled in a clinical trial evaluating the safety and specificity of cetuximab-IRDye800 (NCT01987375). Open-field fluorescence imaging was performed preoperatively and during the surgical resection. Fluorescence intensity was quantified using integrated instrument software, and the tumor-to-background ratio characterized fluorescence contrast., RESULTS: In the preoperative clinic, the open-field device demonstrated potential to guide preoperative mapping of tumor borders, optimize the day of surgery, and identify occult lesions. Intraoperatively, the device demonstrated robust potential to guide surgical resections, as all peak tumor-to-background ratios were greater than 2 (range, 2.2-14.1). Postresection wound bed fluorescence was significantly less than preresection tumor fluorescence (P < 0.001). The repurposed device also successfully identified positive margins., CONCLUSION: The open-field imaging device was successfully repurposed to distinguish cancer from normal tissue in the preoperative clinic and throughout surgical resection. This study illuminated the potential for existing open-field optical imaging devices with overlapping excitation and emission spectra to be used for fluorescence-guided surgery.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To compare efficacy, in terms of disease control/survival in advanced hypopharyngeal and laryngeal lesions, according to treatment strategy (primary surgery, PS or primary chemoradiotherapy, CRT) and invasion pattern (cartilage, CAI or soft tissue involvement, STI)., METHODS: Records from 463 patients with T3 and T4a carcinoma with CAI (n=221) or STI (n=242) treated at a university clinic over 18 years were retrospectively reviewed., RESULTS: Disease-specific survival (DSS) for the CAI group was 70.1% (PS) and 38.4% (CRT), and 76.6% and 46% for the STI group, respectively. Overall survival (OS) for STI was 56.4% (PS) and 30.6% (CRT), and for CAI 51.1% (PS) and 28.5% (CRT) respectively. Positive resection margins and regional neck metastases reduced survival. T3 lesions treated non-operatively still had significantly improved survival versus T4a by >20%., CONCLUSION: Surgery remains an indispensable part of treatment in local advanced hypopharyngeal and laryngeal cancer with high survival results. It should be part of a concept that includes adjuvant (C)RT. For T3 lesions, primary CRT is also acceptable and CAI is not a contraindication for primary CRT. Regional disease is a strong prognostic factor. In spite of adjuvant treatment, DSS deteriorates by about 20% in cases with positive resection margins. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: A recent study identified a survival benefit with prophylactic neck dissection (ND) at the time of primary surgery as compared with watchful waiting followed by therapeutic neck dissection for nodal relapse, in patients with cN0 oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Alternative management of cN0 neck cancer is recommended to minimize the adverse effects of ND, indicating the need for sentinel node biopsy (SNB) and limited neck dissection. We conducted a multicenter Phase II study to examine the feasibility of SNB for clinically N0 OSCC., METHODS: Previously untreated N0 OSCC patients (n=57) with clinical late-T2 or T3 tumors were enrolled across 10 institutions. SNB navigated with multislice frozen section analysis of sentinel nodes (SNs) and SNB supported sentinel node lymphatic basin dissection (SN basin dissection) were performed in a one-stage procedure. The endpoint was to investigate the rate of false-negative metastases after SN basin dissection and SNB alone., RESULTS: Most tumors were late-T2 lesions (n=50; 87.7%). SNs were identified in all patients. A total of 196 SNs were detected. Among these SNs, 35 (17.8%) were positive for metastasis (9 in level I, 12 in level II, 12 in level III, 1 in level V and 2 in the contralateral region of the neck). The false-negative rate of SNB supported by SN basin dissection and SNB alone was 4.5% and 9.1%, respectively. The concordance of the SN status in intraoperative frozen sections with the permanent histopathology was 97.4% (191/196). The sensitivity and specificity of intraoperative pathological evaluation were 85.7% (30/35) and 100% (30/30), respectively. The 3-year overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival was 89.5% and 82.5%, respectively. The OS of SN-negative patients was significantly longer than that of SN-positive patients (P=0.047)., CONCLUSION: The current study verified that SN basin dissection was a useful back-up procedure for SNB performed as a one-stage procedure, showing a low false-negative rate. SNB alone is an appropriate staging method for patients with clinical N0 staging, and a reliable procedure to determine the appropriate levels for neck dissection.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: CD151 is a plasma membrane protein belonging to the tetraspanin family. CD151 represents a putative therapeutic target and has been suggested as a prognostic marker in several cancer types. The present study aims to investigate the prognostic relevance of immunohistochemical CD151 expression in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Tissue microarray (TMA) sections containing samples from 667 cancers of oral cavity, oro- and hypopharynx and larynx, for which follow-up data were available, were analyzed for CD151 expression by immunohistochemistry., RESULTS: Membranous CD151 immunostaining was recorded in 269 (60.3 %) of 446 analyzable cases. Staining was considered weak in 129 (28.9 %), moderate in 98 (22.0 %), and strong in 42 (9.4 %) of cancers. CD151 expression was unrelated to histological grade, tumor stage, nodal status, or surgical margin. There was a tendency towards a somewhat lower prevalence of CD151 expression in tumors of the oral cavity (52.9 % positive) as compared to cancers of the oro-hypopharynx (62.1 %) and larynx (63.3 %; p = 0.0100). CD151 expression had no impact on patient survival., CLINICAL RELEVANCE: In summary, immunohistochemical analysis of CD151 lacks prognostic utility in HNSCC. The high prevalence of CD151 expression in HNSCC emphasizes its putative relevance as a therapeutic target for further development of anti-CD151 drugs.

N2  - The aims of this study were to evaluate clinical outcomes and to determine their predictive factors in patients with oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OCSCC) invading the mandibular bone (T4) who underwent primary radical surgery and fibula free-flap reconstruction. Between 2001 and 2013, all patients who underwent primary surgery and mandibular fibula free-flap reconstruction for OCSCC were enrolled in this retrospective study. Predictive factors of oncologic and functional outcomes were assessed in univariate and multivariate analysis. 77 patients (55 men and 22 women, mean age 62 +/- 10.6 years) were enrolled in this study. Free-flap failure and local and general complication rates were 9, 31, and 22 %, respectively. In multivariate analysis, ASA score (p = 0.002), pathologic N-stage (p = 0.01), and close surgical margins (p = 0.03) were independent predictors of overall survival. Six months after therapy, oral diet, speech intelligibility, and mouth opening functions were normal or slightly impaired in, respectively, 79, 88, and 83 % of patients. 6.5 % of patients remaining dependent on enteral nutrition 6 months after therapy. With acceptable postoperative outcomes and satisfactory oncologic and functional results, segmental mandibulectomy with fibula free-flap reconstruction should be considered the gold standard primary treatment for patients with OCSCC invading mandible bone. Oncologic outcomes are dependent on three main factors: ASA score, pathologic N-stage, and surgical margin status.

T1  - Head and neck melanoma (excluding ocular melanoma): United Kingdom National Multidisciplinary Guidelines.
A1  - Ahmed, O A

Y1  - 2016//
N2  - This is the official guideline endorsed by the specialty associations involved in the care of head and neck cancer patients in the United Kingdom. This paper provides consensus recommendations on the management of melanomas arising in the skin and mucosa of the head and neck region on the basis of current evidence. Recommendations * At-risk individuals should be warned about the correlation between ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure and skin cancer, and should be given advice on UVR protection. (R) * Dermatoscopy can aid in the diagnosis of cutaneous melanoma. (R) * Histological examination after biopsy is essential to confirm the diagnosis and the tumour thickness. (G) * Excisional biopsy is method of choice. (G) * Staging investigations can be performed for both regional and distant disease. (R) * Scanning (computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging) is recommended for patients with high-risk melanoma. (G) * Patients with signs or symptoms of disease relapse should be investigated by imaging. (R) * Imaging of the brain should be performed in patients who have stage IV disease. (G) * Patients with melanoma of unknown primary should be thoroughly examined and investigated for a potential primary source. (R) * Primary cutaneous invasive melanoma should be excised with a surgical margin of at least 1 cm. (G) * The maximum recommended excision margin is 3 cm. (R) * The actual margin of excision depends upon the depth of the melanoma and its anatomical site. (G) * Ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (FNA) or core biopsy of suspected lymphadenopathy is more accurate than 'blind' biopsy. (R) * Open biopsy should only be performed if FNA or core biopsy is inadequate or equivocal. (R) * Prior to lymph node dissection, staging by CT scan should be carried out. (R) * If parotid disease is present without neck involvement, both parotidectomy and neck dissection should ideally be performed. (R) * There is no role for elective lymph node dissection. (R) * Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) can be considered in stage IB and above by specialist skin cancer multidisciplinary teams. (G) * Patients should be made aware that SLNB is a staging procedure, and should understand that it has, as yet, no proven therapeutic value. (R) * All patients with cutaneous melanoma should have their original tumour checked for BRAF gene status, and their subsequent targeted biological therapy based on this. (R) * Patients who develop brain metastases should be considered for stereotactic radio-surgery. (R).

N2  - This is the official guideline endorsed by the specialty associations involved in the care of head and neck cancer patients in the UK. This paper provides consensus recommendations on the management of cutaneous basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma in the head and neck region on the basis of current evidence. Recommendations * Royal College of Pathologists minimum datasets for NMSC should be adhered to in order to improve patient care and help work-force planning in pathology departments. (G) * Tumour depth is of critical importance in identifying high-risk cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC), and should be reported in all cases. (R) * Appropriate imaging to determine the extent of primary NMSC is indicated when peri-neural involvement or bony invasion is suspected. (R) * In the clinically N0 neck, radiological imaging is not beneficial, and a policy of watchful waiting and patient education can be adopted. (R) * Patients with high-risk NMSC should be treated by members of a skin cancer multidisciplinary team (MDT) in secondary care. (G) * Non-infiltrative basal cell carcinoma (BCC) <2 cm in size should be excised with a margin of 4-5 mm. Smaller margins (2-3 mm) may be taken in sites where reconstructive options are limited, when reconstruction should be delayed. (R) * Where there is a high risk of recurrence, delayed reconstruction or Mohs micrographic surgery should be used. (R) * Surgical excision of low-risk cSCC with a margin of 4 mm or greater is the treatment of choice. (R) * High-risk cSCC should be excised with a margin of 6 mm or greater. (R). * Mohs micrographic surgery has a role in some high-risk cSCC cases following MDT discussion. (R) * Delayed reconstruction should be used in high-risk cSCC. (G) * Intra-operative conventional frozen section in cSCC is not recommended. (G) * Radiotherapy (RT) is an effective therapy for primary BCC and cSCC. (R) * Re-excision should be carried out for incompletely excised high-risk BCC or where there is deep margin involvement. (R) * Incompletely excised high-risk cSCC should be re-excised. (R) * Further surgery should involve confirmed marginal clearance before reconstruction. (R) * P+ N0 disease: Resection should include involved parotid tissue, combined with levels I-III neck dissection, to include the external jugular node. (R) * P+ N+ disease: Resection should include level V if that level is clinically or radiologically involved. (R) * Adjuvant RT should include level V if not dissected. (R) * P0 N+ disease: Anterior neck disease should be managed with levels I-IV neck dissection to include the external jugular node. (R) * P0 N+ posterior echelon nodal disease (i.e. occipital or post-auricular) should undergo dissection of levels II-V, with sparing of level I. (R) * Consider treatment of the ipsilateral parotid if the primary site is the anterior scalp, temple or forehead. (R) * All patients should receive education in self-examination and skin cancer prevention measures. (G) * Patients who have had a single completely excised BCC or low-risk cSCC can be discharged after a single post-operative visit. (G) * Patients with an excised high-risk cSCC should be reviewed three to six monthly for two years, with further annual review depending upon clinical risk. (G) * Those with recurrent or multiple BCCs should be offered annual review. (G).

N2  - This is the official guideline endorsed by the specialty associations involved in the care of head and neck cancer patients in the UK. With only limited high-level evidence for management of nasal and paranasal sinus cancers owing to low incidence and diverse histology, this paper provides recommendations on the work up and management based on the existing evidence base. Recommendations * Sinonasal tumours are best treated de novo and unusual polyps should be imaged and biopsied prior to definitive surgery. (G) * Treatment of sinonasal malignancy should be carefully planned and discussed at a specialist skull base multidisciplinary team meeting with all relevant expertise. (G) * Complete surgical resection is the mainstay of treatment for inverted papilloma and juvenile angiofibroma. (R) * Essential equipment is necessary and must be available prior to commencing endonasal resection of skull base malignancy. (G) * Endoscopic skull base surgery may be facilitated by two surgeons working simultaneously, utilising both sides of the nose. (G) * To ensure the optimum oncological results, the primary tumour must be completely removed and margins checked by frozen section if necessary. (G) * The most common management approach is surgery followed by post-operative radiotherapy, ideally within six weeks. (R) * Radiation is given first if a response to radiation may lead to organ preservation. (G) * Radiotherapy should be delivered within an accredited department using megavoltage photons from a linear accelerator (typical energies 4-6 MV) as an unbroken course. (R).

N2  - PURPOSE: We set out to investigate loss of target coverage from anatomy changes in head and neck cancer patients as a function of applied safety margins and to verify a cone beam computed tomography (CBCT)-based adaptive strategy with an average patient anatomy to overcome possible target underdosage., METHODS AND MATERIALS: For 19 oropharyngeal cancer patients, volumetric modulated arc therapy treatment plans (2 arcs; simultaneous integrated boost, 70 and 54.25 Gy; 35 fractions) were automatically optimized with uniform clinical target volume (CTV)-to-planning target volume margins of 5, 3, and 0 mm. We applied b-spline CBCT-to-computed tomography (CT) deformable registration to allow recalculation of the dose on modified CT scans (planning CT deformed to daily CBCT following online positioning) and dose accumulation in the planning CT scan. Patients with deviations in primary or elective CTV coverage >2 Gy were identified as candidates for adaptive replanning. For these patients, a single adaptive intervention was simulated with an average anatomy from the first 10 fractions., RESULTS: Margin reduction from 5 mm to 3 mm to 0 mm generally led to an organ-at-risk (OAR) mean dose (Dmean) sparing of approximately 1 Gy/mm. CTV shrinkage was mainly seen in the elective volumes (up to 10%), likely related to weight loss. Despite online repositioning, substantial systematic errors were present (>3 mm) in lymph node CTV, the parotid glands, and the larynx. Nevertheless, the average increase in OAR dose was small: maximum of 1.2 Gy (parotid glands, Dmean) for all applied margins. Loss of CTV coverage >2 Gy was found in 1, 3, and 7 of 73 CTVs, respectively. Adaptive intervention in 0-mm plans substantially improved coverage: in 5 of 7 CTVs (in 6 patients) to <2 Gy of initially planned., CONCLUSIONS: Volumetric modulated arc therapy head and neck cancer treatment plans with 5-mm margins are robust for anatomy changes and show a modest increase in OAR dose. Margin reduction improves OAR sparing with approximately 1 Gy/mm at the expense of target coverage in a subgroup of patients. Patients at risk of CTV underdosage >2 Gy in 0-mm plans may be identified early in treatment using dose accumulation. A single intervention with an average anatomy derived from CBCT effectively mitigates discrepancies. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

T1  - [Expression of p53, p21, PCNA and COX-2 and its relationship with recurrence in the early-stage laryngeal cancer with negative surgical margin].
A1  - Zeng, Ronghua
Y1  - 2016//
N2  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the relation between the expression of p53, p21, PCNA and COX-2 and local recurrence in resection margins of laryngeal carcinoma operation., METHOD: SElect 98 patients with laryngeal carcinoma, who came to our hospital from Nov, 2005 to Dec, 2010. Diagnosed with early laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma by a pathological examination, all these patients received CO2 laser surgery to cut the entire tumors. Keep the primary lesion and resection margin tissues after that and take 5 mm peritumoral tissue as a sample of operation resection margin. With the chemical method of SP, record in detail the local recurrence condition by clinical diagnosis every 3-6 months or telephone follow-up for 2 years., RESULT: (1)The positive rate of p53, p21, PCNA and COX-2 in the tumor tissues of the 98 patients with laryngeal carcinoma are 65. 3%, 52. 0%, 70. 4% and 69. 4%. The positive rate of p53, p21, PCNA and COX-2 in their resection margin tissues are 23. 5%, 39. 8%, 32. 7% and 30. 6%. So there is no relation between the expression of p53, p21, PCNA and COX-2 in tumor tissue and tumorous grading and TNM staging. (2)There appeared 17 cases of local recurrence in two years, with a recurrence rate of 17. 3%. The recurrence rate of patients with a positive expression of p53, p21, PCNA and COX-2 in resection margin tissue is higher than those with a negative expression(P<0. 05). Among positive cases, the recurrence rate of patients with double positive results is obviously higher than those with single positive results(P< 0. 05). (3)The expression of p21 in p53 positive resection margin tissue is greatly higher than that in negative tissue. The expression of PCNA in p53 positive resection margin tissue is greatly higher than that in negative tissue (P<0. 01); however, the PCNA positive expression in p53 positive cut edge organization rather than in the expression of negative cut edge groups(P>0. 05)., CONCLUSION: Through the discussion on the effect of p53, p21, PC- NA and COX-2 in the process of laryngeal carcinoma cell proliferation and local recurrence, the study proposes that biochemical metabolism and molecular structure level abnormal expression occur before the change of cell morphology apparent, and suggests that positive index should be examined regularly and effective foreseeability intervention can be applied to patients with positive expression.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The oncologic impact of surgical margins after transoral laser microsurgery (TLM) for T1 and T2 glottic carcinoma is controversial. The purpose of this study was to assess the prognostic value of margin status in terms of local control., METHODS: Records of 266 patients treated from 1990 to 2013 were evaluated. Patients with previous cordectomy or without preoperative CT scan were excluded from the study., RESULTS: A total 110 patients (85 T1a, 8 T1b, and 17 T2) were enrolled. A local recurrence was observed in 23 patients. Five-year disease-free survival was significantly impaired in patients with positive margins (p = .009) and in patients with deep involvement of the vocal muscle (p = .004)., CONCLUSION: The present study shows that invaded margin is a factor of poor local control even though laser vaporization was systematically applied after resection. In case of deep vocal fold involvement, TLM should be extended beyond the vocal muscle to improve local control. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Head Neck 38: 1804-1809, 2016.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Definitive assessment of primary site margin status following resection of head and neck cancer is necessary for prognostication, treatment determination and qualification for clinical trials. This retrospective analysis determined how often an independent reviewer can assess primary tumor margin status of head and neck cancer resections based on review of the pathology report, surgical operative report, and first follow-up note alone., METHODS: We extracted from the electronic medical record pathology reports, operative reports, and follow-up notes from head and neck cancer resections performed at Stanford Hospital. We classified margin status as definitive or not. We labeled any pathology report clearly indicating a positive, negative, or close (<5mm) margin as definitive. For each non-definitive pathology report, we reviewed the operative report and then the first follow-up note in an attempt to clarify margin status. We also looked for associations between non-definitive status and surgeon, year, and primary site., RESULTS: 743 unique cases of head and neck cancer resection were extracted. We discarded 255 as non-head and neck cancer cases, or cases that did not involve a definitive resection of a primary tumor site. We could not definitively establish margin status in 20% of resections by independent review of the medical record. There was no correlation between margin determination and surgeon, site, or year of surgery., CONCLUSION: A substantial fraction (20%) of primary site surgical margins could not be definitively determined via independent EMR review. This could have implications for subsequent patient care decisions and clinical trial options. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Previous studies report high-accuracy rates for intraoperative frozen sections, but reliability of frozen sections in predicting the ultimate final margin status is unknown. We compared frozen and permanent reads to identify risk factors for overall discrepancies between intraoperative and final margin status., STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective chart review., METHODS: Pathology reports of 437 surgical resections between 2010 and 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. A total of 253 cases, generating 1,109 individual specimens, met inclusion criteria. Patient demographics, treatment, recurrence, and survival, as well as pathology data pertaining to the specimen, were recorded., RESULTS: Frozen read accuracy was 96.7% (83.1% sensitivity, 97.9% specificity) relative to permanent evaluation. However, 4.3% of cases had a final positive margin not detected by frozen section; 17.8% had a close margin not detected by frozen section. In eight of 11 cases with missed positive margins, the involved margin was never sampled intraoperatively. Cases where intraoperative margins were only taken from surrounding tissue had a higher risk of missing a close or positive final margin when compared to cases where some or all margins were taken from the specimen (odds ratio = 5.05, 95% confidence interval [2.31, 11.07], P <0.0001). Disease subsite, risk score, prior radiation, staging, and p16 expression were not significantly associated with the likelihood of missing a close or positive final margin., CONCLUSION: Individual frozen section reads are highly accurate. However, negative intraoperative margins do not guarantee margin-negative resections. The process of selecting representative margins for intraoperative analysis, specifically the practice of sampling the resection bed, should be refined., LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: N/A.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Treatment of early cancer stages is deeply connected to a good prognosis, a moderate reduction of the quality of life, and comparably low treatment costs., METHODS: Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas were investigated using the multimodal combination of coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS), two-photon excited fluorescence (TPEF), and second-harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy., RESULTS: An increased median TPEF to CARS contrast was found comparing cancerous and healthy squamous epithelium with a p value of 1.8.10(-10) . A following comprehensive image analysis was able to predict the diagnosis of imaged tissue sections with an overall accuracy of 90% for a 4-class model., CONCLUSION: Nonlinear multimodal imaging is verified objectively as a valuable diagnostic tool that complements conventional staining protocols and can serve as filter in future clinical routine reducing the pathologist's workload. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Y1  - 2016//
N2  - Malignant sublingual gland neoplasms are rare, early-stage neoplasms presenting as painless non-ulcerated masses in the antero-lateral floor of the mouth. The majority of patients present with advanced disease, with symptoms of pain or anaesthesia of the tongue. Malignant minor salivary gland neoplasms are more common, the majority (>80%) of which present in the oral cavity, most frequently in the palatal area, as painless masses or as obstructive symptoms in the head and neck region. The most frequent pathologies are adenoid cystic carcinoma and mucoepidermoid carcinoma (>85%), with the majority presenting at an advanced stage (III/IV). Wide tumour-free surgical margin excision is the treatment of choice, followed by radiotherapy, after discussion of the multidisciplinary head and neck cancer tumour board. Improvements in survival and quality of life have been achieved since the introduction of endoscopic and robotic surgeries for many minor salivary gland malignancies. Copyright © 2016 S.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Obtaining free resection margins is the main goal of oncological surgeons. Narrow-band imaging (NBI) has been recently used to help define resection margins in transoral laser microsurgery for laryngeal carcinoma. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of intraoperative NBI in defining the surgical resection margins of oral and oropharyngeal cancers., METHODS: Between January 2014 and March 2015, NBI was used intraoperatively after an initial definition of resection margins with white light in 26 patients (group A). The rate of superficial positive margins at definitive histology was compared with that of a historical cohort of 44 patients (group B) previously managed without the use of intraoperative NBI., RESULTS: A statistically significant reduction in the rate of positive superficial margins was observed at definitive histology in group A (P = .028). NBI helped to identify the presence of dysplasia and cancer around the visible tumor not otherwise detectable with visual examination alone., CONCLUSIONS: NBI could be a useful tool for obtaining free resection margins in oral and oropharyngeal carcinoma.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Margins in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) are determined by morphological changes assessed via hematoxylin-eosin staining. Physiological changes may not be detected by this technique. The purpose of this study was to determine if a protein biomarker, laminin-332gamma2, overexpressed in cancer cells at the invasive front in HNSCC, remains unaffected by heat produced during resection, supporting a role for immunohistochemistry assessment of margins., METHODS: Archived tissue blocks from glottic squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) resected by CO2 laser likely to contain both cancer cells and artifact were identified; 129-paired slides were obtained. One slide of each pair was stained with hematoxylin-eosin; the second stained for laminin-332gamma2. The presence of cancer cells, artifact, and positive laminin-332gamma2 staining was recorded. Twenty-seven pairs met the inclusion criteria., RESULTS: Immunohistochemistry staining of laminin-332gamma is preserved in presence of heat artifact., CONCLUSION: This study supports use of immunohistochemistry to assess margins. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Surgical treatment of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients often results in complex defects, affecting functional structures. Frozen sections are valuable to guide resections and control for adequate margins; however, intraoperative assessment of bone remains challenging., OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the clinical impact of an intraoperative cytological assessment of bone margins (ICAB) on resection status and patient outcome., METHODS: ICAB analysis (n = 267) was implemented in 102 patients during resection of HNSCC for a guided resection of affected bone. The cytological findings were compared with the final histological results of the corresponding bone margins, and the surgical consequences, R1 rates, and patient outcome of the ICAB intervention group were compared with an equal control group of 100 patients., RESULTS: ICAB revealed a sensitivity of 94.4 % [95 % confidence interval (CI) 81.3-99.3], specificity of 97.4 % (95 % CI 94.4-99.0), positive predictive value of 85.0 % (95 % CI 70.2-94.3), and negative predictive value of 99.1 % (95 % CI 96.9-99.9). Osseous R1 resections were reduced from 8 to 2.9 % (R1 = 5.1 %; p = 0.113), rendering a relative risk reduction (RRR) of 63.2 % with a number needed to treat (NNT) of 19.57. ICAB influenced final resection status, with a reduction of R1 resections from 17 to 7.8 % (R1 = 9.2 %; p = 0.026), with an RRR of 59.65 % and an NNT of 9.66. The ICAB intervention group revealed a higher disease-free survival [p(log-rank) = 0.045] and overall survival [p(log-rank) = 0.014] according to multivariable analysis., CONCLUSION: ICAB, applied as a routine diagnostic tool to supplement frozen sections, can help to reduce R1 resections in order to improve patient outcome.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to analyse the impact of surgical margins on tumour recurrence and survival of patients with carcinomas of the head and neck., MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cohort of 156 patients with primary squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck treated by local resection with negative margins and neck dissection between 2004 and 2012 was investigated. Margin status in frozen sections and permanent paraffin tissues were analysed and compared to clinical and histopathological parameters as well as to tumour recurrence (local, regional and distant) and disease-specific survival (DSS)., RESULTS: Close margins (<5mm) on permanent sections were correlated to high-grade differentiation (p=0.070), lymphangiosis (p=0.009) and positive neck nodes (p=0.025) implicating regional and distant recurrence (p=0.001) as well as unfavorable DSS (p=0.002). Positive margins on initial frozen section analysis revised into negative margins during further surgery were the strongest predictor for local recurrence in uni- and multivariate analysis (p<0.001, hazard ratio 3.34). However, positive frozen section margins were not significantly predictive for DSS (p=0.150). Significant predictors for DSS in univariate analysis were local recurrence (p=0.026), T-stage (p=0.02), N-stage (p<0.001), grading (p=0.02) and lymphangiosis (p=0.001). Multivariate DSS analysis revealed lymph node metastasis (p=0.005) and local recurrence (p=0.017) as significant negative predictors., CONCLUSION: Close margins on permanent sections are associated with aggressive tumour characteristics, regional and distant metastasis implicating worse DSS. The accuracy of frozen section analysis seems limited as positive frozen section margins revised into negative margins bear a high risk of local recurrence. Copyright © 2016.

N2  - We investigated the frequency of microsatellite alteration and their impact on survival in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients from an endemic betel quid chewing area. We collected 116 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma specimens along with corresponding surgical margins which were confirmed by pathological examination. Ten oligonucleotide markers were chosen for the assessment of microsatellite alteration. The specimens were amplified by polymerase chain reaction followed by automatic fragment analysis. There were 44 specimens (37.9%) with microsatellite instability (MSI) in at least one marker while more than half of the specimens (n = 68, 58.6%) had loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in at least one marker. Though MSI/LOH was not correlated with the survival of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients, presence of MSI in the tumor-free surgical margins was associated with local recurrence (odds ratio: 15.14; 95% confidence interval: 6.451 ~ 35.53; P < 0.001). Genomic assessment of surgical margin can help surgeons to identify head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients who are at risk of developing local recurrence in a betel quid-prevalent region.

N2  - An estimated 200,000 deaths each year worldwide are due to cancer of the head and neck, mostly mucosal squamous cell carcinoma and nonmelanoma skin cancer. The status of surgical margins is important for prognosis and need for adjuvant therapy. We will discuss how margin status impacts outcomes and therapy, and the conundrum of determining margin status. Copyright © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - PURPOSE: There are few clinical studies focusing on treatment outcomes of lip cancer. This study investigated the clinicopathologic variables of a large sample of patients with lip squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) treated in a reference head and neck cancer center for the past 25 years and analyzed the influence of these variables on treatment outcomes., MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective cohort study reviewed the clinical records of patients with LSCC. Epidemiologic data were age, gender, ethnicity, type of occupation, tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption, comorbid conditions, and family cancer history. Clinicopathologic features included the lip location of the tumor, TNM classification, clinical staging, histopathologic grade, surgical margin analysis, and treatment modality. Local recurrence, second primary tumor, and survival were the outcome variables. Statistical analysis was performed by chi(2) test, Fisher exact test, and binary logistic regression analysis. Survival analysis was assessed through the Kaplan-Meier curve. Level of statistical significance was set at a P value less than .05 for all tests., RESULTS: In total, 144 patients with LSCC were studied. There were 117 men (81.25%) and 27 women (18.75%) with a mean age of 60.21 years. One hundred thirty-four patients (93.05%) were considered of white ethnicity, and in 57 cases (39.58%), the patients reported an occupation that was related to long-term solar exposure. Most cancers had initial clinical staging of 1 or 2 (84.02%). Microscopically, lesions were predominantly well (43.05%) and moderately (40.96%) differentiated tumors. Clinical staging was related to a specific higher survival rate (P = .0049). One hundred twelve cases (77.78%) underwent surgical treatment and only 6 patients (4.80%) had local recurrence, which was directly associated with compromised surgical margins (P = .0320)., CONCLUSION: A high success rate in LSCC treatment was observed in this study. Compromised surgical margin was associated with tumor recurrence and is a critical event in lip cancer treatment. Copyright © 2016 American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.

Our aim was to retrospectively examine a large group of patients with OSCC to determine the staging significance of bone invasion., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three hundred and twenty-three patients with primary OSCC were classified based on tumor size. Bone invasion was categorized as absent, one side bone, and both buccal and lingual bones, and analyzed for association with disease progression. Regional lymph node metastasis (N), perineural invasion, vascular invasion, surgical margin involvement, and adjuvant treatment were also analyzed., RESULTS: In all OSCC cases, bone invasion (p=0.007) with stage N, perineural invasion, and surgical margin involvement were significant independent prognostic factors of disease progression. However, in OSCC cases with tumors measuring 4cm or less, bone invasion was not significantly associated with disease progression. Nevertheless, invasion of both buccal and lingual bones was significantly associated with disease progression (p=0.03). In multivariate analysis, both buccal and lingual bone invasion (p=0.04; hazard ratio=3.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-11.0), stage N2, and perineural invasion were also independent prognostic factors., CONCLUSION: Although OSCC bone invasion was an independent prognostic factor, bone invasion in small OSCC was not. However, small OSCC with both buccal and lingual bone invasion had a significantly worse prognosis. The AJCC T system is of limited prognostic value for small OSCC with bone invasion. But other elements should be examined before a modification can be accepted. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - BACKGROUND: A positive margin is among the most significant factors that affects the outcome in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). The purpose of this study was to compare the negative margin rates between 2 methods of intraoperative margin assessment in patients with oral cavity SCC., METHODS: A prospective, randomized controlled trial comparing 2 methods of intraoperative margin assessment: specimen-driven margins and patient-driven margins., RESULTS: The final analysis included 71 patients, 20 (29%) in the patient-driven margin arm. Frozen section analysis revealed positive/close surgical margins that led to an extension of the surgical resection in 22 of 51 patients (43%) in the specimen-driven margin arm, and 2 of 20 patients (10%) in the patient-driven margin arm (p = .01). After final pathological analysis, the wide negative margin rate was 84% in the specimen-driven margin arm, compared to 55% in the patient-driven margin arm (p = .02). Extension of the surgical resection prevented escalation of adjuvant treatment in 19 patients (38%) in the specimen-driven margin arm and 10% in the patient-driven margin arm., CONCLUSION: Specimen derived margin assessment led to significant improvement in the rate of negative margins. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Factors associated with disease-free survival (DFS) after salvage therapy for recurrent oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in the context of human papillomavirus (HPV) are poorly understood., METHODS: A retrospective cohort analysis was conducted of patients with recurrent oropharyngeal SCC with known HPV tumor status who received salvage therapy., RESULTS: Eighty-six patients were eligible for analysis. Sixty-four patients (74%) were HPV-positive. In multivariable analysis, HPV-positive tumor status (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.30; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.13-0.71; p = .007), clinical response to any salvage therapy (HR = 0.29; 95% CI = 0.11-0.77; p = .01), and surgical salvage (HR = 0.38; 95% CI = 0.16-0.88; p = .02) were associated with improved overall survival (OS). Positive surgical margin was associated with worse DFS after salvage (HR = 8.43; 95% CI = 1.99-35.70; p = .004)., CONCLUSION: For recurrent oropharyngeal SCC, HPV-positive tumor status, surgical salvage, and clinical response to salvage therapy are independently associated with improved OS, but not DFS after salvage. Surgical margin is the only independent predictor of DFS. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Head Neck 38: E1501-E1509, 2016. Copyright © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

T1  - Optical Diagnosis of Head and Neck Cancers.

Y1  - 2016//
N2  - Head and neck cancer is one of the most common malignancies. Currently, it has a poor prognosis and significant mortality as the majority of malignancies present in later stages. Early diagnosis affords early intervention and the best chance of cure. However, the current gold standard for diagnosis largely depends on histopathology via an invasive procedure, tissue biopsy. The processing of biopsy material also inevitably leads to diagnostic delay and the possibility of taking an unrepresentative sample. Recently, there has been significantly increasing interest in the use of spectroscopy (e.g., fluorescence, elastic scattering, and Raman spectroscopy) and other optical systems to provide an early, real-time, non-invasive, and in situ diagnosis. Such diagnosis is based on the fact that the optical spectrum derived from any tissue reveals information about the histological and biochemical characteristics of that tissue. These optical systems have not only a role in cancer detection but also in treatment through guided biopsy, surgical margin assessment, and the monitoring of therapeutic drugs. However, our literature search is limited only to clinical diagnosis and only to the clinical trials published within recent 15 years (in 2000-2014). In this review, we will discuss and summarize the progress and new findings from recent clinical trials using these optical systems in the diagnosis of head and neck cancer.

N2  - Transoral surgery is a less invasive treatment that is becoming a major strategy in the treatment of laryngo-pharyngeal cancer. It is a minimally invasive approach that has no skin incision and limits the extent of tissue dissection, disruption of speech and swallowing muscles, blood loss, damage to major neurovascular structures, and injury to normal tissue. Transoral approaches to the laryngo-pharynx, except for early glottis cancer, had been limited traditionally to tumors that can be observed directly and manipulated with standard instrumentation and lighting. Since the 1990s, transoral laser microsurgery (TLM) has been used as an organ preservation strategy with good oncological control and good functional results, although it has not been widely used because of its technical difficulty. Recently, transoral robotic surgery (TORS) is becoming popular as a new treatment modality for laryngo-pharyngeal cancer, and surgical robots are used widely in the world since United States FDA approval in 2009. In spite of the global spread of TORS, it has not been approved by the Japan FDA, which has led to the development of other low-cost transoral surgical techniques in Japan. Transoral videolaryngoscopic surgery (TOVS) was developed as a new transoral surgery system for laryngo-pharyngeal lesions to address the problems of TLM. In TOVS, a rigid endoscope is used to visualize the surgical field instead of a microscope and the advantages of TOVS include the wide operative field and working space achieved using the distending laryngoscope and videolaryngoscope. Also, with the spread of narrow band imaging (NBI), endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) and endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD), which are widely used for superficial cancers in the gastrointestinal tract, have been applied for the superficial laryngo-pharyngeal cancer. Both EMR and ESD are performed mainly by gastroenterologists with a sharp dissector and magnifying endoscopy (ME)-NBI with minimal surgical margin. Endoscopic laryngo-pharyngeal surgery (ELPS) was developed to treat laryngo-pharyngeal superficial cancer by modifying the ESD procedure. The concept of ELPS is the same as that of ESD, however, the resection procedure is performed by a head and neck surgeon with both hands using a ME-NBI and rigid curved laryngo-pharyngoscope. These four procedures are low cost with similar oncological and functional outcomes to TORS. TORS may be less expensive than chemoradiotherapy, but the number of hospitals that can afford da Vinci surgical systems is limited. Even in the era of robotic surgery, these four procedures will be good options for laryngo-pharyngeal cancer. Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer originating in the neck of the gland occurs in the small region surrounded by the common hepatic artery (CHA), gastroduodenal artery (GDA), and portal vein (PV). The specific clinicopathologic characteristics of pancreatic neck cancer remain unclear. Our aim was to identify specific biologic behaviors of pancreatic neck cancer for the improvement of treatment outcomes., METHODS: This study was a retrospective cohort study with a comparative outcomes design. In 63 of 325 consecutive patients (19.4%) with pancreatic cancer who underwent operation, the tumor was located in the pancreatic neck. Clinicopathologic characteristics and prognostic factors specific to pancreatic neck cancer were analyzed by comparison with those of pancreatic head or body/tail cancers., RESULTS: The rates of radiographic and pathologic PV and/or superior mesenteric vein (PV/SMV) invasion were greater in patients with pancreatic neck cancer (radiographic, 84%; pathologic, 37%) than those with pancreatic head and body/tail cancers (radiographic: 67% head, 25% body/tail; pathologic: 26% head, 6% body/tail). The most frequent lymph node (LN) metastases were found in the region along the CHA in pancreatic neck cancer, and the areas most likely to show a positive surgical margin were the dissected surface of the PV and the root of the GDA and/or CHA. For pancreatic neck cancer patients, 5 independent poor prognostic factors were found: pathologic PV/SMV invasion (P = .005), moderately or poorly differentiated tumors (P = .001), positive LN ratio of >=0.1 (P < .001), distance from surgical margin of <=1 mm (P = .018), and inability to complete the planned postoperative adjuvant therapy (P < .001)., CONCLUSION: Pancreatic neck cancer showed specific clinicopathologic characteristics and prognostic factors after resection.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Incomplete surgical removal of cancer is believed to be the main cause of local recurrence and high mortality. This study assessed the use of optical technology (namely optical coherence tomography [OCT]) in examining oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) resection margins to assess if this modality could guide the surgeon during surgical resections., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-eight T1-T2 N0M0 oral squamous cell carcinoma patients participated in this study. Nineteen patients were males and nine were females. The majority of lesions were in the ventro-lateral tongue, floor of mouth, retromolar trigone and the buccal mucosa. Following tumour resection, the specimen resection margins were optically scanned in the immediate ex vivo phase. Two independent assessors commented on the four resection margins of each specimen. The findings were then compared to the corresponding gold standard histopathology. The average epithelial thickness for both tumor-free and tumor-involved margins was also calculated., RESULTS: The pathology reports of the 112 margins revealed 90 tumor-free margins and 22 tumor-involved margins. Examining the data from both senior operating surgeons (assessors), the overall sensitivity and specificity was found to be 81.5% and 87%, respectively. Whilst the positive predictive value was 61.5% and the negative predictive value was 95%. OCT accuracy for the first assessor was 88% and for the second assessor 84%. The assessors' inter-observer agreement was "very good" for superior, inferior and medial margins; while agreement on the lateral surgical margin status was "good". Using OCT, the mean epithelial thickness at the tumor-free resection margins was 360 mum; while, it was 567 mum for the tumour-involved margins., CONCLUSION: OCT is a valuable tool in the assessment of surgical margins. Tumour-involved margins can be identified by architectural changes and increase in epithelial layer thickness on the OCT image. Further studies are required to assess tumour margins in vivo.

N2  - The purpose of this review was to identify publications on resection margins in oral cancer surgery and compare these with the results from 2 Dutch academic medical centers. Eight publications were considered relevant for this study, reporting 30% to 65% inadequate resection margins (ie, positive and close margins), compared to 85% in Dutch centers. However, clinical outcome in terms of overall survival and recurrence seemed comparable. The misleading difference is caused by lack of unanimous margin definition and differences in surgicopathological approaches. This prevents comparison between the centers. Data from Dutch centers showed that inadequate resection margins have a significantly negative effect on local recurrence, regional recurrence, distant metastasis, and overall survival. These results confirm the need for improvement in oral cancer surgery. We underline the need for consistent protocols and optimization of frozen section procedures. We comment on development of optical techniques for intraoperative assessment of resection margins. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Head Neck 38: E2197-E2203, 2016.

N2  - Cancer of the gingiva is a rare disease in the Western World. It most commonly affects elderly population. Because of its rarity, the reporting on the disease is sparse and often grouped with other subsites of oral cancer, which makes conclusions difficult to interpret. The aim of this paper is to review the literature on gingival cancer as a specific subsite of oral cancer and report on published prognostic factors as well as treatment of local and regional disease. We also present differences between gingival cancer subgroups, mandibular and maxillary gingival cancer. In addition, both surgical and oncological treatments are reviewed. It seems that surgery is the preferred initial treatment approach for the majority of patients with gingival cancer, although adjuvant radiation, with or without chemotherapy, is commonly recommended to increase locoregional control.

N2  - PURPOSE: This multicenter phase III study evaluated the efficacy and safety of lapatinib, an epidermal growth factor receptor/ErbB2 inhibitor, administered concomitantly with chemoradiotherapy and as maintenance monotherapy in patients with high-risk surgically treated squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN)., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with resected stage II to IVA SCCHN, with a surgical margin <= 5 mm and/or extracapsular extension, were randomly assigned to chemoradiotherapy (66 Gy total radiation dose and cisplatin 100 mg/m(2) per day administered on days 1, 22, and 43) plus placebo or lapatinib (1,500 mg per day) before and during chemoradiotherapy, followed by 12 months of maintenance monotherapy., RESULTS: Six hundred eighty-eight patients were enrolled (lapatinib, n = 346; placebo, n = 342). With a median follow-up time of 35.3 months, the study ended early because of the apparent plateauing of disease-free survival (DFS) events. Median DFS assessed by an independent review committee was 53.6 months and not reached for lapatinib and placebo, respectively (hazard ratio, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.85 to 1.43). Investigator-assessed results confirmed the independent review committee assessment. No significant differences in DFS by human papillomavirus status or overall survival were observed between treatment arms. Similar numbers of patients in both treatment arms experienced adverse events (AEs), with more patients in the lapatinib arm than the placebo arm experiencing serious AEs (48% v 40%, respectively). The most commonly observed treatment-related AEs were diarrhea and rash, both predominantly in the lapatinib arm., CONCLUSION: Addition of lapatinib to chemoradiotherapy and its use as long-term maintenance therapy does not offer any efficacy benefits and had additional toxicity compared with placebo in patients with surgically treated high-risk SCCHN.

N2  - Molecular deep surgical margin analysis has been shown to predict locoregional recurrences of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). To improve the accuracy and versatility of the analysis, we used a highly tumor-specific methylation marker and highly sensitive detection technology to test DNA from surgical margins. Histologically cancer-negative deep surgical margin samples were prospectively collected from 82 eligible HNSCC surgeries by an imprinting procedure (n = 75) and primary tissue collection (n = 70). Bisulfite-treated DNA from each sample was analyzed by both conventional quantitative methylation-specific PCR (QMSP) and QMSP by droplet digital PCR (ddQMSP) targeting Paired box 5 (PAX5) gene promoter methylation. The association between the presence of PAX5 methylation and locoregional recurrence-free survival (LRFS) was evaluated. PAX5 methylation was found in 68.0% (51 of 75) of tumors in the imprint samples and 71.4% (50 of 70) in the primary tissue samples. Among cases that did not have postoperative radiation (n = 31 in imprint samples, n = 29 in tissue samples), both conventional QMSP and ddQMSP revealed that PAX5 methylation-positive margins was significantly associated with poor LRFS by univariate analysis. In particular, ddQMSP increased detection of the PAX5 marker from 29% to 71% in the nonradiated imprint cases. Also, PAX5 methylated imprint margins were an excellent predictor of poor LRFS [HR, 3.89; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.19-17.52; P = 0.023] by multivariate analysis. PAX5 methylation appears to be an excellent tumor-specific marker for molecular deep surgical margin analysis of HNSCC. Moreover, the ddQMSP assay displays increased sensitivity for methylation marker detection. Copyright ©2015 American Association for Cancer Research.

N2  - The primary goal of surgical oncology is to obtain a tumour resection with disease-free margins. Transoral robotic surgery (TORS) for surgical treatment of head-neck cancer is commensurate with standard treatments. However, the likelihood of positive margins after TORS is up to 20.2% in a recent US survey. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and the feasibility of narrow-band imaging (NBI) during TORS in order to improve the ability to achieve disease-free margins during tumour excision. The present study was conducted at the ENT, Head- Neck Surgery and Oral Surgery Unit, Department of Special Surgery, Morgagni Pierantoni Hospital, Azienda USL Romagna. From March 2008 to January 2015, 333 TORS were carried out for malignant and benign diseases. For the present study, we retrospectively evaluated 58 biopsy-proven squamous cell carcinoma patients who underwent TORS procedures. Patients were divided into 2 groups: (1) 32 who underwent TORS and intra-operative NBI evaluation (NBI-TORS); (2) 21 who underwent TORS with standard intra-operative white-light imaging (WLITORS). Frozen section analysis of margins on surgical specimens showed a higher rate of negative superficial lateral margins in the NBI-TORS group compared with the WLI-TORS group (87.9% vs. 57.9%, respectively, p = 0.02). The sensitivity and specificity of intra-operative use of NBI, respectively, were 72.5% and 66.7% with a negative predictive value of 87.9%. Tumour margin enhancement provided by NBI associated with magnification and 3-dimensional view of the surgical field might increase the capability to achieve an oncologically-safe resection in challenging anatomical areas where minimal curative resection is strongly recommended for function preservation.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to compare preoperative fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) and intraoperative frozen section (FS) for the correct identification of malignancy, histological grade, and histological type., METHODS: FNAC was performed on all 105 patients and FS on 71 patients with parotid carcinoma., RESULTS: The rate of correctly determining the histological grade by FNAC and FS was 32% and 73%, respectively. The correct diagnosis rate for both the histological type and grade by FNAC and FS was 20% and 48%, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: The correct grading of both high and low/intermediate grade carcinoma is possible in 70-80% of patients by FS. If the histological grade is identified correctly, the extent of resection can usually be decided appropriately. Therefore, we should put emphasis on determining the histological grade.

N2  - OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: High-resolution microendoscopy (HRME) provides real-time visualization of the mucosal surface in the upper aerodigestive tract. This technology allows noninvasive discrimination of benign and neoplastic epithelium and has potential applications for intraoperative margin detection., STUDY DESIGN: Single institution, prospective, feasibility trial (phase I) of in vivo optical imaging., METHODS: The study was conducted on patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the upper aerodigestive tract. High-resolution microendoscopy images obtained during surgery were correlated with histopathologic diagnosis to determine the ability of HRME to differentiate between benign and malignant mucosa. Blinded reviewers evaluated HRME images and made determinations of the status of the mucosa. Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and interrater agreement between multiple raters were calculated to determine the accuracy of HRME imaging., RESULTS: The mean accuracy of reviewers in differentiating neoplastic or benign mucosa was 95.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 94%-96%). Sensitivity and specificity were 96% (95% CI, 94%-99%) and 95% (95 % CI, 90%-99%), respectively. The NPV was 98% (95% CI, 97%-99%), and PPV was 91% (95% CI, 85%-98%). The Fleiss kappa statistic for interrater reliability was 0.81, with a standard error of 0.014 and a 95% CI (0.78-0.84)., CONCLUSION: High-resolution microendoscopy allows real-time discrimination between benign and neoplastic mucosa. High levels of sensitivity and specificity can be obtained with this technology when interrogating mucosal surfaces. Despite several technical limitations, HRME shows promise as a technique for intraoperative margin control and platform for molecular imaging technologies., LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3b.

N2  - BACKGROUND: A prerequisite of irradiation after advanced head and neck tumour resection is the accurate localization of the tumour resection margin. The purpose of the following study is to evaluate the use of surgical clips placed in the tumour resection margins for use as radiographic markers to facilitate focussed adjuvant radiation therapy., MATERIALS: To evaluate whether the clips remain predictive for the resection margin, we analysed the deviation of each clip in two postoperative CT scans on different days. Bone registration points were used to fuse the two CT scans in the region of the primary tumour and the distances between corresponding clips were measured., RESULTS: The tumour resection margins were labelled with an average of 18 titanium clips. In total 282 clips were evaluated. Metric analysis of clip deviation between the two postoperative CT scans found a mean distance of 4.5 mm +/- 2.5 mm with a range of 0.5-11.8 mm. No significant statistical relationship of the clip differences as a function of time, the method of reconstruction or administered radiotherapy could be demonstrated., CONCLUSION: Placement of surgical clips in the cavity walls after complete tumour resection provides an easy and inexpensive approach for defining resection margins and allows for increased accuracy of adjuvant treatment.

Y1  - 2015//
N2  - BACKGROUND: Warthin's tumours can show features of pseudo-neoplasia. They do not usually cause problems for diagnosis and management when present within the parotid gland. However, extraparotid Warthin's tumours that are associated with pseudo-neoplasia upon cytological analysis can mimic metastatic malignant disease. The case of a patient presenting with multifocal extraparotid Warthin's tumours is described., CASE REPORT: A 57-year-old male smoker presented with rapidly growing upper neck lumps. Fine needle aspiration cytology, magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography findings were compatible with metastatic squamous cell carcinoma secondary to either an unknown primary upper aerodigestive or a parotid malignancy. The patient subsequently underwent total conservative parotidectomy and modified radical neck dissection. Final histology findings revealed multifocal benign Warthin's tumours with four extraparotid components., CONCLUSION: Warthin's tumours may present outside the parotid gland, present with multifocal lesions and mimic metastatic disease. Frozen section examination prior to radical resection should be considered to guide management.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Securing negative surgical margins is a critical goal for head and neck surgery. Local recurrence develops even in some patients who have histologically negative surgical margins. Minimal residual tumor cells may lead to locoregional recurrence despite clear histologic margins reported at the time of resection of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). To identify subclinical residual disease, the authors analyzed deep margin imprint samples collected on 1-layer nitrocellulose sheets., METHODS: Bisulfite-treated DNA samples from 73 eligible patients were amplified by quantitative methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (QMSP) targeting 6 genes (deleted in colorectal cancer [DCC], endothelin receptor type B [EDNRB], homeobox protein A9 [HOXA9], kinesin family member 1A [KIF1A], nidogen-2 [NID2], and N-methyl D-aspartate receptor subtype 2B [NR2B]). QMSP values were dichotomized as positive or negative. Associations between the QMSP status of deep margin samples and clinical outcomes were evaluated., RESULTS: Two-gene methylation combinations among the genes DCC, EDNRB, and HOXA9 were associated with decreased locoregional recurrence-free survival, recurrence-free survival, and overall survival. The methylated gene combination of EDNRB and HOXA9 in margin imprints was the most powerful predictor of poor locoregional recurrence-free survival (hazard ratio [HR], 3.31; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.30-8.46; P = .012) independent of standard histologic factors. In addition, methylation of both EDNRB and HOXA9 indicated a trend toward reduced recurrence-free survival (HR, 2.74; 95% CI, 0.90-8.33; P = .075) and reduced OS (HR, 5.78; 95% CI, 0.75-44.7; P = .093) in multivariable analysis., CONCLUSIONS: A panel of gene methylation targets in deep surgical margin imprints provides a potential predictive marker of postoperative locoregional recurrence. Intraoperative use of molecular margin imprint analysis may assist surgeons in obtaining rigorously negative surgical margins and improve the outcome of head and neck surgery.

N2  - CONCLUSIONS: Because computed tomography (CT) lymphography provides preoperative images of anatomic relationships between a tumor, its associated lymph vessels, and the sentinel lymph node (SLN), it may aid in directing the SLN biopsy for management of early tongue cancer., OBJECTIVES: SLN biopsy using a radioisotope (RI) generally has been performed in head and neck cancer. However, this method can be performed only at institutions that are licenced for its use. In this study, we evaluated the utility of performing SLN biopsy in patients with early tongue cancer using the newly developed technique of CT lymphography., METHODS: Enrolled in this study were 31 patients with T1N0 or T2N0 tongue cancer. CT images were obtained before and after injection of iopamidol into the peritumoral region and the SLN was identified as the first enhanced lymph node. SLN biopsy was performed using CT lymphographic guidance combined with blue dye injection., RESULTS: The SLN was detected by CT lymphography in 28 cases (90.3%). By intraoperative frozen section examination, metastases to SLNs were found in 4 (14.3%) (T1N0, 1 patient; T2N0, 3 patients) of the 28 patients. Of these four, SLN micrometastases were found in one patient.

A1  - Clark, L J
Y1  - 2015//
N2  - BACKGROUND: Branchial cleft cysts occur because of a failure of involution of the second branchial cleft. However, as well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma can mimic branchial cleft cysts, there is a lack of consensus on the appropriate management of cystic neck lumps., OBJECTIVE: To report our experience of fine needle aspiration cytology and frozen section examination in the management of cystic neck lumps., METHOD: Retrospective case note review of patients managed in the Southern General Hospital, Scotland, UK., RESULTS: The sensitivity of fine needle aspiration cytology and frozen section for detecting branchial cleft cysts was 75 per cent and 100 per cent respectively. Two patients who did not undergo intra-operative frozen section examination were either over- or under-treated, which is discussed., CONCLUSION: Adult patients subjected to surgical excision of a suspected branchial cyst should undergo intra-operative frozen section analysis regardless of clinical suspicion for malignancy. This part of management is critical to ensure patients are offered appropriate treatment.

N2  - OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To identify histopathologic features associated with poor correlation of frozen and permanent pathology margins following wide local excision for advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck., STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review., METHODS: A retrospective review of patients undergoing excision of advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinomas between the years 2010 AND 2013 was performed. Demographic, operative, and pathology data were collected. Overall correlation between frozen section margins and final margins on permanent section results was calculated. Positive and negative predictive values of several histopathologic features were determined., RESULTS: Forty-one cases were identified from the database. Perineural invasion, lymphovascular invasion, and a component of poorly differentiated carcinoma were identified in 61.3%, 34.5%, and 17.1% of cases, respectively. Discrepancy between frozen section margins and permanent margins was identified in eight cases (19.5%). The false-negative rate for poorly differentiated carcinoma, lymphovascular invasion, and perineural invasion was 14%, 36%, 26%, respectively. The positive and negative predictive value of poorly differentiated carcinoma, lymphovascular invasion, and perineural invasion in predicting discrepancy between frozen and permanent margins was 14% and 80%, 36% and 84%, and 26% and 92%, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated a moderate rate of discrepancy between frozen and permanent section analysis of operative margins from high-risk cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck. The presence or absence of certain histopathologic features appears to be associated with a higher rate of frozen section discrepancy. Evaluation of these features in a preoperative biopsy or staging excision may be useful in planning definitive excision and reconstruction.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: The use of free-flap reconstruction requires a more limited neck dissection to allow for microvascular anastomosis. This study seeks to determine the oncologic validity of cervical vessel preservation., MATERIALS AND METHODS: The current study is a prospective review of cervical vessel biopsies from patients undergoing resection of squamous cell carcinoma (SCCA) tumors of the head and neck with free tissue reconstruction., RESULTS: From June 2010 to March 2012, 227 recipient vessel biopsies were performed on 100 patients. Three of these patients had grossly abnormal vessels, with malignancy confirmed by frozen section analysis. One patient had a vessel positive for malignancy that was grossly normal but found to have SCCA on the final pathology., CONCLUSIONS: When the recipient vessel appears grossly suspicious, a frozen section biopsy and re-resection should be considered. Recipient vessel trimmings should routinely be sent for permanent pathology since in rare cases, they can be involved by tumor, affecting the margin status, prognosis, and indications for adjuvant therapy.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Securing the negative surgical margin is the first step in surgical cancer treatment. However, tumor recurrence sometimes occurs even with histologically negative surgical margins. To detect minimal residual cancer cells in the deep margin intraoperatively, a time-efficient molecular approach is required., METHODS: We established an innovative rapid quantitative methylation PCR (QMSP) assay, which consists of substantially time-minimized DNA extraction, bisulfite treatment, and QMSP assays. To demonstrate the feasibility of this procedure, 10 serial surgical specimens of primary head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) were evaluated by both rapid and conventional QMSP. Two frequently methylated genes in head and neck cancer, homeobox A9 (HOXA9) and endothelin receptor type B (EDNRB) were analyzed in 10 HNSCCs and surgical margin tissues, as well as normal muscle and oral mucosa samples., RESULTS: The product quality of DNA extraction and bisulfite treatment using the time-saving procedure was comparable to the conventional procedure. In the QMSP assay, target gene methylation and reference gene methylation were equally detected by both the rapid and conventional method. Finally, relative results of rapid and conventional QMSP were quite similar to each other in tumors, margins, and normal tissues. The average total time required for the rapid QMSP procedure was less than 3 h and could be accomplished by a single person., CONCLUSION: From the viewpoint of accuracy, cost, and time consumption, the innovative rapid QMSP maintains highly sensitive methylation detection accomplished within the time frame of a major ablative and reconstructive procedure.

N2  - PURPOSE: Surgical margin status frequently affects decisions regarding adjuvant treatment; however, reporting and interpretation of surgical margins is subject to considerable subjectivity because of many factors including the adequacy of resection. We developed a novel measure of the adequacy of surgical resection, the tumor: specimen index (TSI), and tested its utility at predicting clinical outcomes in a retrospective cohort study., PATIENTS AND METHODS: An institutional database was queried to identify previously untreated patients with T1 and T2 oral tongue cancer who underwent surgery during 1985-2009 (n=433). The TSI, a geometric mean representing the percentage of the surgical specimen that is occupied by the tumor in average single dimension, was calculated from the largest measured lengths, widths, and heights of the tumor in relation to the entire surgical specimen. Multivariate analyses of locoregional recurrence-free probability (LRRFP) and disease-specific survival (DSS) were performed with commonly accepted prognosticators in addition to TSI and surgical margins status., RESULTS: The mean TSI was 41 (range 11-90; SD 14). Surgical margin status was associated with TSI; margins were negative in 84% of patients with TSI<45 and in 63% of patients with TSI45 (p<0.001). TSI45 was associated with worse LRRFP (57% vs. 76%, p<0.001) and worse DSS (68% vs. 85%, p<0.001). In a multivariate analysis that did not include TSI, surgical margin status independently predicted LRRFP (p=0.014) but not DSS. When TSI was included, only TSI, and not surgical margin status, was an independent predictor of both LRRFP (p=0.002) and DSS (p=0.011)., CONCLUSION: The tumor: specimen index is an easily-calculated metric for estimating the adequacy of 3-dimensional resection in T1 and T2 oral tongue cancer that independently predicts oncologic outcomes.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The cost-effectiveness of the frozen section for assessment of margin in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is still contentious. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether gross examination of margin is an alternative to frozen section., METHODS: It was a prospective observational study in 145 consecutive patients undergoing surgery for HNSCC. Surgical margins were first assessed by the surgeons with a metallic scale. All specimens were then examined using frozen section and permanent section., RESULTS: Overall, 83% of inadequate margins were detected by frozen section. The chances of inadequate margin were very low if gross surgical margin were 7 mm or more. Gross examination alone (with 7 mm as cutoff) predicted 88% of the inadequate surgical margin. There was no difference in precision of frozen section vis-a-vis gross examination with 7 mm cut off (p <= .8)., CONCLUSION: Achievement of 7 mm surgical margin measured by a surgeon obviates the need for frozen section.

N2  - In this retrospective cohort study, we evaluated the oncological and functional outcomes of transoral videolaryngoscopic surgery (TOVS). Using distending laryngoscope and videolaryngoscope, wide operative field and working space could be obtained and tumor could be resected in en bloc. Sixty patients with T1, T2, and selected T3 laryngeal or pharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas (Stage I: n = 17, Stage II: n = 16, Stage III: n = 7, Stage IV: n = 20 cases) were enrolled and followed up for at least 24 months or until the patient's death. Fifty-three patients underwent initial treatment, and seven patients had recurrent cancer after chemoradiation. In principle, node-positive patients underwent a simultaneous neck dissection. Patients with multiple nodal metastases or a positive surgical margin received postoperative radiotherapy. For initial treatment, the 5-year overall survival and disease-specific survival rates were 77 and 95 %, respectively. For supraglottic and hypopharyngeal cancers, the 5-year laryngeal preservation rates were 89 and 96 %, respectively. For salvage surgery, the overall survival, disease-specific survival, and laryngeal preservation rates were 75, 75, and 80 %, respectively. The median times before patients could resume eating and swallowing a soft diet were 6 and 9 days, respectively. The patients' Functional Outcome Swallowing Scale stages were 0-2 in 93.3 % of the cases and 3 or 4 in 6.7 % of the cases. A percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy was indicated for 1 (1.7 %) patient. Four (6.7 %) patients received transient tracheostomy. TOVS is a satisfactory and minimally invasive treatment option for laryngeal and pharyngeal cancers.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to perform an oncologic analysis of patients treated for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma of an unknown primary (HNCCUP)., PATIENTS AND METHODS: 35 cases were included in our monocentric restrospective study (1999-2010). All patients had a complete clinical exam as well as head, neck and chest CT scans. The primary tumour remained undetected after panendoscopy 25 patients underwent a routine tonsillar biopsy ipsilateral to the lymphadenopathy. In 9 cases (36%), an invasive squamous cell carcinoma was detected on pathological examination. These patients were excluded from further study. Kaplan-Meier method was used for survival analysis. Univariate and multivariate analysis were also performed using Cox's regression model., RESULTS: The therapeutic management of patients' majority (73%) consisted of lymphadenectomy with frozen section examination which confirmed the presence of an invasive squamous carcinoma in the resected lymph node(s). This was followed by ipsilateral neck dissection and radiotherapy or radiochemotherapy. Patients with unresectable lymph node(s) underwent exclusive radiochemotherapy. Specific survival rates at 1, 3 and 5 years were respectively 77%, 52% and 47%. The median survival time was 3 years. The comparison of univariate and multivariate survival curves confirmed that the lymph node status is an important factor for survival (HR 8.3 [2.03-33.96])., CONCLUSION: Our results are consistent with those found in the medical literature. HNCCUP has a poor prognosis which correlates with the lymph node status.

N2  - OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: A study was undertaken to determine the oncologic outcomes in a consecutive series of early glottic carcinomas treated with transoral CO2 laser microsurgery (TLM) as a one-stage single-modality therapy, without any postoperative radiation therapy or retreatment with laser. We further evaluated correlations between the oncologic outcomes and clinicopathologic factors including tumor location and surgical margin., STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of medical records., METHODS: The medical records of 118 consecutive patients with early stage (T1, T2) glottic carcinoma who underwent TLM by a single surgeon as an initial treatment from 1997 to 2011 were retrospectively reviewed. The oncologic outcomes were evaluated, and correlations to clinicopathologic factors were analyzed., RESULTS: The 5-year disease-free survival, ultimate local control with laser alone, disease-specific survival, overall survival, and organ preservation rates were 87.9%, 94.2%, 99.0%, 92.2%, and 96.2%, respectively. Neither the reported surgical margin nor the extension of tumor to the anterior commissure, arytenoid, subglottis, and ventricle showed any significant impact on local control or survival., CONCLUSIONS: Transoral CO2 laser microsurgery as one-stage single-modality therapy resulted in a high rate of local control and a high survival rate in selected cases of early glottic carcinoma, regardless of the location of tumor and histopathology report on the surgical margin.

N2  - The aim of this systematic review is to evaluate the definition of close margin in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), and its possible prognostic significance. An appropriate string was run on PubMed to retrieve articles discussing the 'close' surgical margin issue in HNSCC. A double cross-check was performed on citations and full-text articles retrieved. In total, 348 articles were identified. Further references were included by using the option "Titles in your search terms" option in PubMed. 15 papers were finally included for qualitative synthesis. In vocal cord surgery of HNSCC, a close margin could be considered to be <=1 mm, in the larynx <=5 mm, in the oral cavity <=4 mm, and in the oropharynx <=5 mm. In each patient, the choice of extent of close margin should be balanced against general condition, tumor stage, and functional issues to indicate appropriate adjuvant therapy.

N2  - Adequate resection margins are critical to the treatment decisions and prognosis of patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). However, there are numerous controversies regarding reporting and interpretation of the status of resection margins. Fundamental issues relating to the basic definition of margin adequacy, uniform reporting standards for margins, optimal method of specimen dissection, and the role of intraoperative frozen section evaluation, all require further clarification and standardization. Future horizons for margin surveillance offer the possible use of novel methods such as "molecular margins" and contact microscopic endoscopy, However, the limitations of these approaches need to be understood. The goal of this review was to evaluate these issues to define a more rational, standardized approach for achieving resection margin adequacy for patients with HNSCC undergoing curative resection.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: A history of radiation therapy is known to be a major risk factor promoting post-surgical complications. By comparing the clinical outcomes of supracricoid laryngectomy with cricohyoidoepiglottopexy (SCL-CHEP) in irradiated and non-irradiated patients, we investigated the usefulness of salvage SCL-CHEP., METHODS: 73 patients who received SCL-CHEP between 1997 and 2010 (30 had received radiation therapy preoperatively and 43 had not). Staging error, wound infection, accuracy of surgical margin determination, acquired laryngeal function, and prognosis were compared between the two groups., RESULTS: Staging error occurred in 6/30 (20%) irradiated and 14/43 (33%) non-irradiated patients. An intraoperative margin study demonstrated a dysplastic or positive margin in 15/30 (50%) irradiated and 13/43 (30%) non-irradiated patients. Wound infection developed in 12/30 (40%) irradiated and 7/43 (16%) non-irradiated patients (P<0.05). Delayed wound infection was identified in four patients with a radiation dose over 65Gy. Swallowing function (ability to eat in public) was acquired in 28/30 (93%) irradiated and 39/43 (91%) non-irradiated patients. Five-year larynx preservation rates were 94% in irradiated and 91% in non-irradiated patients. Five-year overall survival rates were 81% in irradiated and 87% in non-irradiated patients., CONCLUSIONS: Risk of infection was significantly higher in irradiated patients; delayed infection should be appropriately managed. Functional and oncological results were stable regardless of radiation history. We encourage head and neck surgeons to take reasonable risks in performing salvage SCL-CHEP.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) develops in the mucosal linings of the upper aerodigestive tract. HNSCC may develop in large preneoplastic fields, which are in most cases invisible, but can be detected microscopically and by genetic analysis., METHODS: Cells of mucosal tissue biopsies were cultured and genetically analyzed. Genetic changes in established preneoplastic cultures were compared to the corresponding tumor and surgical margins., RESULTS: Of 45 mucosal tissue biopsies taken from primary tumor resection specimen, 26 were successfully cultured and could be genetically analyzed. In 1 culture, genetic changes were found and an immortalized preneoplastic cell line was obtained with genetic changes that were also found in a surgical margin of the corresponding specimen., CONCLUSION: Our data show that noninvasive fields surrounding HNSCC may consist of immortalized preneoplastic cell clones. Our preneoplastic cell line is a valuable tool to develop and test treatment strategies for precursor fields in patients with HNSCC. Copyright © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - BACKGROUND: In squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, when lesions reach or cross the midline, there is a higher risk of contralateral nodal metastasis. Identifying factors that are associated with higher risk of nodal metastasis may help in optimizing the treatment., METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted of all patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue who had undergone bilateral neck dissection at Tata Memorial Hospital between January 2007 and June 2010 for a lesion crossing or reaching the midline., RESULTS: Contralateral nodal metastases were present in 71 of 243 patients (29%) who underwent bilateral neck dissection. Of these 71 patients, 69 patients (97%) had ipsilateral nodal metastasis., CONCLUSION: In carcinoma of the tongue, where lesions reach or cross the midline, the chance of contralateral nodal metastases without ipsilateral nodal metastasis is extremely rare. Frozen section of ipsilateral neck dissection can be a pointer for addressing the contralateral neck. Copyright © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Metatypical cell carcinoma (MTC) is a quite rare malignancy accounting for 5% of all non melanoma skin cancers, with features of basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. It can be described as coexistence of basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma with no transition zone between them., AIM: Our review identified a correlation between gender and MTC affected region., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of 312 consecutive patients, diagnosed for MTC localized on face and scalp. Statistical analysis was made to determinate most affected areas, gender prevalence, average age, presence of ulceration and infiltration and peripheral clearance rate., RESULTS: A relevant difference came out between two genders. chi2 test emphasized a relation between males and the presence of carcinoma on the scalp. In addition a strong correlation between mixed subtype and ulceration was evident. A strong relation between intermediate subtype and positive surgical margin was found; this data could identify a more aggressive behavior of intermediate type., CONCLUSIONS: In our findings an important correlation between sun exposition and this tumor was found. Moreover, due to the difficulties that can occur in preserving the aesthetic subunits in the surgical treatment of these regions, the prevention of this pathology has an important role.

T1  - Surgical margins in the genomic era: The Hayes Martin Lecture, 2012.

Y1  - 2012//
N2  - One of the highest honors of one's career is to be asked to address colleagues, mentors, and students who represent the world's leading health professionals dedicated to reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with head and neck cancer. Hayes Martin would certainly share this feeling of honor and humility in having a lecture given in his name on the occasion of the Eighth International Conference on Head and Neck Cancer. I am so very pleased to share with you some thoughts on the assessment, adequacy, and application of surgical resection margins in an era in which personalized surgery and molecular medicine will have a major impact on patient outcomes. My thoughts about surgical margins have evolved over nearly 40 years of performing surgical resections for cancer. A discussion of margins may seem somewhat mundane to many of you; however, I hope to provide a futuristic and somewhat theoretical view of how surgical margin issues will relate to the personalization of modern head and neck cancer treatment and how the biology of the tumor microenvironment may be instructive in the application of our surgical approaches. This is particularly relevant because of the rapid expansion of functional surgical approaches utilizing minimally invasive endoscopic resections and robotic techniques that may not achieve the same wide oncologic margins that have been emphasized historically.(1,2) Proper selection of patients for such procedures is critical if we are to improve overall treatment results.

N2  - Simultaneous multiple free flaps have become a useful option in head and neck reconstructions. We performed a 10-year retrospective study between 2001 and 2010. There were 58 men and 1 woman. The overall mortality rate was 51.7%. The longest surviving patient is 9 years and 4 months, whereas the shortest surviving patient was 72 days. The mean survival period was 47.1 (6.8) months. Age (P = 0.755) and tumor size (P = 0.115) did not play a major role, but surgical margin, lymph node, and tumor recurrence were significant in patient survival with a P value of 0.026, 0.01, and 0.026, respectively. If wide excision with a margin that can be free of tumor can be performed, lymph nodes are not involved, and this is a primary tumor, then time and effort should be spent in a successful simultaneous multiple free flap reconstruction.

N2  - OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To evaluate the reliability of the sentinel node (SN) biopsy in early oral squamous cell carcinomas., STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort study., METHODS: We conducted a primary prospective study on 53 consecutive patients presenting T1, T2 N0 squamous cell carcinomas of the oral cavity between January 2000 and June 2003. Primary results demonstrated a negative predictive value of 100%. The series was then extended until June 2010, with a total number of 166 successful procedures., RESULTS: The cohort accounted for 118 males and 48 females with a mean age of 56 years. The median follow-up period was 36 months. There were 42 patients (25%) with positive SNs, 14 of them (33%) only harboring micrometastasis. The negative predictive value of the sentinel node biopsy was 95.2%. The SN involvement was strongly correlated with the tumor location (34% of SN+ for the tongue vs. 13% for the floor of mouth, P = .003), tumor stage (18% of SN+ for T1 vs. 40% for T2, P = .002), depth of invasion (median depth for SN+ lesions was 6.5 mm vs. 4 mm for SN- lesions, P = .028), and lymphovascular involvement (P = .002). The false-negative rate of frozen section examination was 42%., CONCLUSIONS: The sentinel node biopsy appears to be an excellent staging method in early oral cancers. This study also provides evidence that routinely undiagnosed micrometastasis may have clinical significance. Copyright © 2012 The American Laryngological, Rhinological, and Otological Society, Inc.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The efficacy of ablative surgery for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) depends critically on obtaining negative margins. Although intraoperative "frozen section" analysis of margins is a valuable adjunct, it is expensive, time-consuming, and highly dependent on pathologist expertise. Optical imaging has potential to improve the accuracy of margins by identifying cancerous tissue in real time. Our goal was to determine the accuracy and inter-rater reliability of head and neck cancer specialists using high-resolution microendoscopic (HRME) images to discriminate between cancerous and benign mucosa., METHODS: Thirty-eight patients diagnosed with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) were enrolled in this single-center study. HRME was used to image each specimen after application of proflavine, with concurrent standard histopathologic analysis. Images were evaluated for quality control, and a training set containing representative images of benign and neoplastic tissue was assembled. After viewing training images, seven head and neck cancer specialists with no previous HRME experience reviewed 36 test images and were asked to classify each., RESULTS: The mean accuracy of all reviewers in correctly diagnosing neoplastic mucosa was 97% (95% confidence interval (CI), 94-99%). The mean sensitivity and specificity were 98% (97-100%) and 92% (87-98%), respectively. The Fleiss kappa statistic for inter-rater reliability was 0.84 (0.77-0.91)., CONCLUSIONS: Medical professionals can be quickly trained to use HRME to discriminate between benign and neoplastic mucosa in the head and neck. With further development, the HRME shows promise as a method of real-time margin determination at the point of care.

N2  - Surgery plays an important role in the treatment of head and neck cancer (HNC), and surgical margin status is a key prognostic factor. Molecular imaging (MI) can be applied to identify tumor extensions intraoperatively. We applied this technique in a murine HNC model to determine whether it improves outcomes from surgical intervention. An orthotopic murine model with HNC was established with SCC VII cells expressing a green fluorescent protein. To determine the diagnostic accuracy of MI, 20 murine models undergoing standard surgical resection were assessed with MI to identify residual tumor, which was compared to histology as the gold standard. Then, to assess the effect of MI as a therapeutic intervention for survival, 65 mice were randomly divided into standard surgical resection, MI-assisted surgical resection, and control groups. In the MI-assisted surgery group, residual signals identified by MI underwent further tissue excision to eliminate the signal positivity. In diagnostic accuracy analysis, sensitivity and specificity of intraoperative MI in the HNC murine model were 86% and 100%, respectively. The mice undergoing MI-assisted surgery showed a significantly improved 60-day survival rate compared to standard surgery, 37% versus 5%, respectively. Intraoperative MI guidance is a promising technique in oncologic surgery, which could increase the efficacy of tumor resection and the survival of patients with HNC. The hurdles in applying this technique in clinical practice are still considerable, and further research and development is warranted. Copyright © 2011 UICC.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Sentinel node (SN) biopsy in the head and neck region has not been widely used in Japan, except at a few facilities. However, almost all these facilities perform preoperative localization and intraoperative diagnosis by frozen section analysis of SN to select patients who must undergo neck dissection in a one-stage procedure. The objective of this study was to determine the actual status of SN biopsy at those facilities in Japan that have actively conducted this procedure, and to elucidate the usefulness and drawbacks of this technique in head and neck cancer., METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 177 patients who had undergone SN biopsy at 7 facilities. The underlying pathology was laryngeal or hypopharyngeal cancer in 20 patients from one hospital, while the remaining 157 patients had oral cancer. Preoperative localization of SN was determined using conventional lymphoscintigraphy with or without single photon emission computed tomography with CT (SPECT-CT). Intraoperative localization and diagnosis of SN were performed by gamma probe and frozen section analysis., RESULTS: Conventional lymphoscintigraphy detected a mean of 2.6 SNs per patient in 137 patients with oral cancer, compared to 2.7 in 71 patients using SPECT-CT and 2.9 in 154 patients using the gamma probe. No significant differences were apparent between techniques. Forty of the 520 SNs (7.7%; 33 in oral cancer and 7 in laryngeal or hypopharyngeal cancer) were pathologically positive in the final diagnosis. Of these, 3 were not processed for frozen sectioning and were diagnosed only with hematoxylin and eosin staining. Among the others, 32 (86.5%) were diagnosed intraoperatively as showing metastasis. In terms of the false-negative rate, 144 patients were determined by SN biopsy to have no positive SNs. Of these, 2 patients had non-SN metastases found in their dissected neck and 8 patients without neck dissection showed late nodal recurrence. The false-negative rate was thus 6.9%., CONCLUSION: Frozen section analysis, particularly multislice sectioning, offers a relatively reliable intraoperative diagnostic method. We were able to perform immediate neck dissection based on the results of multislice sectioning as a single-stage procedure. Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prognostic implications of p53 expression in the surgical margins of laryngeal squamous cell carcinomas., METHODS: Thirty one patients with T3-4N0M0 cancers with pathologically negative margins were analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) to detect expression of p53., RESULTS: The p53 positive rates by IHC in the surgical margin were 16.1% (5/31). In the p53 positive margin group, the recurrent rate was higher than those without (80% vs 19.2%, P = 0.006). Also, the median free of disease period in the p53 positive margin group was shorter than other group (22.2 vs 47.8 months, P < 0.0001)., CONCLUSIONS: We found that the overexpression of p53 can serve a prognostic role for both recurrence and disease-specific mortality in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. p53 expression could stratify patients, in an easy and inexpensive way, according to their risk of local or regional recurrence.

N2  - The focus of this study is to investigate the retention and biodistribution of technetium-99m ((99m)Tc) labeled liposomes in a human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) positive surgical margin animal xenograft model. Positive surgical margin (with margin<1mm) in HNSCC is associated with significant higher mortality and recurrence rate when compared to clear margin. An immediate intraoperative application of liposome-carried therapeutic agents may treat the residual disease intraoperatively and improve long term survival in these patients. To understand the feasibility of this intraoperative therapy in HNSCC, the in vivo behavior of liposomes after intraoperative administration of (99m)Tc-labeled liposomes using non-invasive nuclear imaging was investigated in an animal xenograft model. Neutral and cationic (99m)Tc-labeled liposomes of 100 nm, 1 microm and 2 microm in diameter (6 study groups with 4 rats per study group) were injected into a nude rat HNSCC positive surgical margin xenograft model. Intratumoral, locoregional, and systemic retention and distribution of the (99m)Tc-liposomes were determined using non-invasive nuclear imaging and post-mortem organ distribution. The (99m)Tc-liposomes demonstrated high locoregional retention rate of 55.9+/-3.7% to 72.9+/-2.4% at 44 h after intraoperative injection to allow significant radiation to the surgical cavity if therapeutic radionuclides were used. Overall, the cationic liposomes demonstrated higher intratumoral retention rate, and the neutral liposomes showed greater retention in the paratumoral cavity (p<0.05 respectively). In conclusion, intraoperative therapy with liposome carried radionuclide drug delivery system carries great potential in treating unresectable HNSCC, and further study using therapeutic radionuclide should be explored.

N2  - In previous studies we demonstrated telomerase activity in frozen tissue from head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and their tumor-free tumor margins. In the present study frozen sections from the same tissues were examined for in situ presence of hTERT. In preliminary investigations we established that the most suitable method of tissue preparation was fixation in acetone and methanol followed by steaming and visualization by APAAP. Most of the assays involved eleven anti-hTERT antibodies and were supplemented with the inclusion of antibodies Ki-67, anti-nucleolin and CD45. hTERT expression was investigated in the tissues of 61 patients with HNSCC and 37 patients without tumor. Semi-quantitative immunoreactive scores were correlated with telomerase activity. We examined the prognostic significance of hTERT expression with Kaplan-Meier curves and tested the immunological specificity of the antibodies by immunoabsorption with two hTERT peptides and a nucleolin peptide. Nuclear staining of satisfactory distribution and intensity was achieved in seven anti-hTERT antibodies both in the carcinomas and in the squamous epithelia of the tumor resection margins and in the control tissues. Proof of hTERT did not differ from telomerase activity. The telomerase activity demonstrated in tumor-free resection margins and in control tissues did, however, correlate with lymphocytic-monocytic infiltration (CD45 expression). This telomerase activity might be related to nuclear hTERT expression in the squamous epithelium, given that the hTERT score values in the connective tissue tended to be negative. The prognostic significance of hTERT expression demonstrated on paraffin sections from different tumor localizations was not confirmed for the frozen sections of patients with HNSCC. The hTERT specificity of the monoclonal NCL-L-hTERT, whose use as an antibody against hTERT has been questioned, was re-examined with immunohistochemical methods, but the intensity of its immunoabsorption with the nucleolin peptide did not exceed that observed in the other anti-hTERT antibodies.

N2  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Sentinel node biopsy (SNB) is emerging as a potential tool to evaluate neck node metastasis in head and neck cancer. The purpose of this article is to undertake a systemic review of published literature and to outline future directions for further studies., RECENT FINDINGS: Existing data suggest that the status of the sentinel lymph node (SLN) predicts the pathologic stage of the nodal basin. It has been demonstrated that radiolabeled lymphoscintigraphy is superior to blue dye to localize the SLN in head and neck cancer. SLN biopsy should be recommended only in patients with previously untreated early stage (T1/2) oral cavity and orophparynx cancer with clinical N0 stage. The procedure is technique sensitive. The isolated SLN should be subjected to serial step sectioning at 150 microm and staining by hematoxylin and eosin and immunohistochemistry. Intraoperative frozen section and imprint cytology are not sensitive to identify small foci of micrometastasis and isolated tumor cells within the SLN. The clinical relevance of micrometastasis and isolated tumor cells needs to be established. It is necessary to develop a better method for intraoperative pathological confirmation of SLN metastasis. There exists no randomized clinical trial with adequate power that compares SNB and elective neck dissection in head and neck cancer., SUMMARY: SNB in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma should be considered as an investigational tool pending validation by larger randomized clinical trials; therefore, it should not be recommended at present outside a clinical trial setting.

T1  - Intraoperative consultation (IOC) in mucosal lesions of the upper aerodigestive tract.
A1  - Wenig, Bruce M
Y1  - 2008//
N2  - Intraoperative consultation (frozen section) plays an important part in the treatment of the head and neck cancer patient. The appropriate use of intraoperative consultations (frozen sections) usually results in a definitive diagnosis with immediate therapeutic impact while the patient is in the operating room. Among the determinations made by frozen section analysis include the evaluation of adequacy of surgical margins of resection; the differentiation between nonneoplastic, benign and malignant proliferations; the evaluation of lymph nodes for the presence of metastatic disease; the determination of specimen identification and specimen adequacy, including the verification of such organs as the parathyroid glands; and the determination of whether a given case requires special diagnostic testing best performed on frozen material, such as for lymphomas. This paper focuses on intraoperative consultation of mucosal lesions of the upper aerodigestive tract, including epithelial dysplasia and squamous cell carcinoma. Other issues that often not diagnosed or at issue at the time of surgery, including the diagnosis of microinvasive carcinoma and differentiating inflammatory lesions from neoplastic lesions are included for completion.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Metastases are the primary cause of cancer treatment failure and death, yet metastatic mechanisms remain incompletely understood., METHODS: We studied the molecular basis of head and neck cancer metastasis by transcriptionally profiling 70 samples from 27 patients-matching normal adjacent tissue, primary tumor, and cervical lymph node metastases., RESULTS: We identified tumor-associated expression signatures common to both primary tumors and metastases. Use of matching metastases revealed an additional 46 dysregulated genes associated solely with head and neck cancer metastasis. However, despite being metastasis-specific in our sample set, these 46 genes are concordant with genes previously discovered in primary tumors that metastasized., CONCLUSIONS: Although our data and related studies show that most of the metastatic potential appears to be inherent to the primary tumor, they are also consistent with the notion that a limited number of additional clonal changes are necessary to yield the final metastatic cell(s), albeit in a variable temporal order.

N2  - PURPOSE: Positive surgical margins in advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) have a well-documented association with an increased risk of locoregional recurrence and significantly poorer survival. Traditionally, unresectable tumor is treated with postoperative radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy. However, these therapeutic options can delay treatment and increase toxicity. The potential value of intraoperative injection of liposomal therapeutic radionuclides as a locoregional, targeted therapy in unresectable advanced HNSCC was assessed in a nude rat xenograft positive surgical margin model., EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The therapeutic effects of beta-emission rhenium-186 (186Re) carried by liposomes into the tumor remnants in a nude rat squamous cell carcinoma xenograft model were studied. Following the partial resection of tumor xenografts, the animals were intratumorally injected with 186Re-labeled or unlabeled (control) neutrally charged or positively charged 100-nm-diameter liposomes. Tumor size, body weight, hematology, and toxicity were monitored for 35 days posttherapy., RESULTS: The neutral (n = 4) and cationic (n = 4) liposome control groups showed an increase in tumor growth of 288.0 +/- 37.3% and 292.2 +/- 133.7%, respectively, by day 15. The 186Re-neutral-liposome group (n = 8) and the 186Re-cationic-liposome group (n = 8) presented with an average final tumor volume of 25.6 +/- 21.8% and 28.5 +/- 32.2%, respectively, at the end of the study (day 35). All groups showed consistent increases in body weight. No significant systemic toxicity was observed in any of the animals., CONCLUSIONS: With excellent tumor suppression and minimal side-effect profile, the intraoperative use of liposomal therapeutic radionuclides may play a role in the management of positive surgical margins in advanced HNSCC.

N2  - For laryngeal cancer, surgical excision of the primary tumor should be undertaken with the aim of achieving tumor-free margins. Adequate pathological assessment of the specimen and the competency of the treatment center play a crucial role in achieving cure. The present study aimed to analyze the significance of place of surgery on the outcome of patients with laryngeal cancer who underwent surgical operation in other centers and were subsequently referred to Dokuz Eylul University Head and Neck Tumour Group (DEHNTG) for postoperative irradiation. Patients were divided into three groups according to their place of surgery. The first group (Group I) consisted of patients who had their surgical operation at DEUH. Patients in the second group (Group II) were referred from centers with oncological surgical experience. The third group (Group III) consisted of patients referred from hospitals with no surgical teams experienced in head and neck cancer treatment. The clinical and pathological features of patients in these three groups were analyzed to assess the impact of place of surgery on clinical outcome as well as the prognostic factors for survival. The study population consisted of 253 patients who were treated between 1991 and 2006 with locally advanced laryngeal cancer according to the protocol of DEHNTG. The median follow-up was 48 (3-181) months. The 5 years overall, loco-regional disease-free and distant disease-free survivals were 66, 88 and 91%, respectively. When patients' clinical and histopathological features were analyzed for the impact of place of surgery, surgical margin positivity rates were found to be higher in Group III (P = 0.032), although the other two groups had more advanced clinical and pathological N stage disease (P = 0.012, P = 0.001). In multivariate analysis, older age (P < 0.0001), presence of perinodal invasion (P = 0.012), time interval between surgery and radiotherapy longer than 6 weeks (P = 0.003) and tumor grade (P = 0.049) were the most significant factors. For loco-regional failure-free survival, advanced clinical stage (P = 0.002), place of surgery (P = 0.031) and presence of clinical subglottic invasion (P = 0.029) were shown to be important prognostic factors. For distant metastasis-free survival, only pathological (+) lymph node status (P = 0.046) was a significant factor in multivariate analysis. The significance of place of surgery as well as other well-known prognostic factors underlines the importance of an experienced multidisciplinary treatment team if best results are to be obtained for the patient.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the accuracy of intraoperative assessment of the node-negative N0 neck with frozen-section biopsy., METHODS: In our study, 60 patients 9 women and 51 men who underwent 88 elective neck dissections with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, in the Department of Otorhinolaryngology Medical Faculty, Cukurova University, Adana, Turkey, from January 2003 to December 2006, were reviewed retrospectively., RESULTS: Of the 88 clinically preoperatively staged N0 necks, 22 necks 25% were shown subsequently to have metastatic disease after final pathological assessment. In 16 out of 22 cases, frozen-section biopsy revealed metastatic disease, and surgery was changed to a modified comprehensive neck dissection. In another 6 cases, the sampled lymph nodes were considered negative at frozen-section analysis, and metastatic disease was found in the final histopathologic reports. There was no false-positive result. The specificity and positive predictive values were both 100%. The sensitivity of intraoperative lymph node assessment was 73%, and the negative predictive value was 91%., CONCLUSION: Intraoperative assessment of the N0 neck with frozen-section biopsy seems to improve the accuracy of staging and may alter the intraoperative treatment strategy.

N2  - PURPOSE: Surgical margin status is reported to be a relevant prognostic factor in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), associated with a high risk of local recurrence. This study examines whether gene-promoter hypermethylation could be detected in HNSCC surgical margins with no histologic evidence of malignancy, and if so, whether it reflects epigenetic events of primary tumors., EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Promoter methylation status of MGMT, p16, and DAP-K genes was evaluated by methylation-specific PCR in 20 primary HNSCC tumors. Histopathologically negative surgical margins of hypermethylated tumors were collected, and their methylation status compared with the primary tumor status., RESULTS: Promoter hypermethylation in at least one of the three tested genes was detected in 65% (13 of 20) of tumors. MGMT was hypermethylated in 50% (10 of 20), DAP-K in 45% (9 of 20), and p16 in 20% (4 of 20) of tumors. Methylation status was analyzed in 35 margins from 11 of 13 patients showing promoter hypermethylation in the tumor tissue. Identical methylation events were seen for at least one gene in primary tumor and surgical margins in 9 of 11 cases (82%). Association was found for gene-specific hypermethylation status in tumors and paired surgical margins, and gene-specific concordance was 63% for MGMT (kappa = 0.24), 90% for DAP-K (kappa = 0.74), and 90% for p16 (kappa = 0.79)., CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the hypothesis that detection of gene promoter hypermethylation in HNSCC tumor cells-free surgical margins may be a helpful biomarker to identify molecularly altered fields in areas adjacent to the tumor.

N2  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To look at the current published literature on squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck, at the microscopic level, and the implications of molecular and genetic research., RECENT FINDINGS: The goal of surgical treatment is still complete eradication of the primary tumour with a 'safe margin'. To achieve this 'safe margin' is not always possible, however. Currently, there is no agreed consensus as to how to submit tissue for frozen section, or how to define a 'clear margin'. Histopathologically, there are two margins requiring analysis, the mucosal margin and the 'deep margin'. Margins declared histopathologically 'tumour free' can be found to be positive for malignant/premalignant cells when molecular markers are applied. When the presence of genetically altered cells is suggested in the margins, there is an increased risk of a recurrent or new tumour. There is limited application of such knowledge and further trials are awaited., SUMMARY: Standard histopathology has limitations for examining surgical margins. The probability of recurrent malignant disease is explained and this is much increased when molecular markers are identified in the resected margins. Further studies are required.

N2  - We discuss our surgical philosophy concerning the subtle interplay between the size of the surgical margin taken and the resultant morbidity from ablative oncological procedures, which is ever more evident in the treatment of head and neck malignancy. The extent of tissue resection is determined by the "trade off" between cancer control and the perioperative, functional and aesthetic morbidity and mortality of the surgery. We also discuss our dilemmas concerning recent minimally invasive endoscopic microsurgical techniques for the trans-oral laser removal or co-ablation of aero-digestive tract tumours, which result in a minimal surgical margin of oncological clearance. By a process of inductive argument as to the nature of the surgical margin, we consider whether the risks of taking a lesser margin with adjuvant therapy is justified by the attendant gain in reduced surgical morbidity and the possible costs in tumour control.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Negative resection margins are likely the most important prognostic factor for a patient with a head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Frozen-section evaluation allows a positive margin to be corrected before surgical closure and reconstruction. A final pathology report is later issued after examination of all resected tissues. The accuracy of the final pathology report relies on accuracy in the preceding steps. The current process of margin reporting in head and neck cancer resections was studied to reveal possible waste and error in the system., METHODS: Two hundred pathologists were surveyed about their center's current process of frozen-section margin evaluation. The authors of the current study used the membership log of the North American Society of Head and Neck Pathology and the list of the top 50 US cancer centers according to US News and World Report. The authors analyzed the process of frozen-section procedure using Toyota industry principles of quality improvement., RESULTS: The majority of surgeons send small fragments of tissue from the surgical defect cavity. Many pathologists receive small unoriented tissue fragments. Many resample all or most of the margins for the final pathology report without anatomic orientation from the surgeon. Other pathologists do not sample any margins., CONCLUSIONS: Final margin reporting redundancy and waste is due mainly to lack of anatomic correlation at interdisciplinary hand-offs. Oversampling and undersampling of margins may be occurring, and the accuracy of the final pathology report may be compromised. There is currently no consensus on how to best submit tissue for frozen-section evaluation of head and neck resection margins. Copyright 2006 American Cancer Society.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The sentinel node concept has become one of the most interesting topics in the treatment of head and neck cancer. The aim of this article is to report the results of our feasibility study and clinical application of sentinel lymph node (SLN) radiolocalization and biopsy in patients with clinically negative neck oral cancer., METHODS: Individuals with previously untreated N0 oral cancer participated in the study. The radioactive tracer used was 99m Tc phytate. Lymphoscintigrams were taken in the feasibility study, and fusion images of SPECT and CT were obtained in the clinical SLN biopsy (SLNB) group. In the feasibility study, metastases to SLNs and other nodes were analyzed in permanent specimens. In the clinical application group, we investigated the comparative effectiveness of multi-slice frozen section analysis and imprint cytology for the intraoperative diagnosis of SLNB., RESULTS: Fifteen individuals participated in the feasibility study. Six SLNs in five patients were cancer-positive, and two thirds of the SLNs were micrometastases. The SLN concept was established, and SLNs with the highest to the third highest radioactivity reflected the patients' neck status accurately. Twelve patients participated in the clinical application group of SLNB. Intraoperative diagnosis of the three hottest SLNs correctly predicted the neck status of 10 patients. Three patients underwent modified radical neck dissection on the basis of the intraoperative diagnosis of cancer metastasis to SLNs, whereas neck dissections were spared in patients with no evidence of such metastases. There were two false-negative cases. One involved a failure of the intraoperative diagnosis of SLNB, and the other had cancer-negative SLNs and cancer-positive non-SLNs. Considering intraoperative diagnosis, multi-slice frozen section analysis was found to be superior to imprint cytology in its sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy on a lymph node basis. No differences were found in any of these indices of intraoperative SLNB on a patient basis. The fusion images of SPECT and CT proved very useful during intraoperative SLNB., CONCLUSIONS: The sentinel node concept was established in the head and neck region. Analyzing the three hottest SLNs suffices to predict a patient's neck status. Multi-slice frozen section analysis was shown to be superior to imprint cytology for detecting micrometastasis to SLN. Intraoperative SLNB based on fusion images of SPECT and CT proved to be an easy, accurate, and reliable method. Copyright 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - UNLABELLED: SUBJECT MATTER: Following clinical diagnosis of a recurrent tumor, curative treatment is seldom available. Depending on the size of the recurrent tumor and the patient's general health condition, extensive surgical resections and reconstructions are avoided in favor of nonsurgical treatment modalities with palliative intent. According to the literature, location of the tumor, tumor size and R-1 and R-2 resection rates are the most frequent reasons for the development of recurrent tumors., PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a retrospective evaluation, a population of 1000 patients who had been treated for primary head and neck cancer during the period from 1979 to 1996 were analyzed descriptively. Survival probabilities of patients with recurrent tumors were calculated according to the Kaplan-Meier product-limit method, and different treatment concepts were compared and analyzed with the log-rank test for significant differences., RESULTS: The largest proportion of primary tumors involved the floor of the mouth (n=369, 36.9%). A total of 198 patients (19.8%) developed recurrent cancer; 79.8% of patients experienced recurrent cancer within 2 years following primary treatment. Within the group of T1/T2 tumors the incidence of recurrent tumors was 28.9%, whereas the incidence in the T3/T4 group was 44.6%. Tumor infiltration of the resection margins was detected in 12.9%., CONCLUSIONS: In line with the literature, tumor infiltration of the resection margins is a relevant prognostic factor; therefore, intraoperative frozen section must be recommended. Treatment with curative intention, in particular extensive surgical resections, is seldom possible and always requires a very intensive discussion with the patient.

N2  - PURPOSE: Postoperative radiotherapy is used to prevent local recurrence of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma in patients with positive surgical margins. We sought to determine whether tetranucleotide microsatellite instability could be detected in surgical margins and used to predict local recurrence., EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We prospectively collected tumor and surgical margin specimens from patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma who had undergone surgical resection at Institut Gustave-Roussy during a 1-year period. Margins were considered positive if extensive pathological examination revealed either carcinoma within 5 mm or dysplasia. We tested five tetranucleotide microsatellite markers (UT5085, L17686, D9S753, ACTBP2, and CSF1R) in the tumor specimens and paired surgical margins of the patients whose margins were negative on pathological examination., RESULTS: Pathological examination revealed that among the 76 patients, 22 had positive margins; therefore, these patients were excluded. Of the 54 remaining patients, 26 (48%) had tumors informative for markers UT5085, L17686, or both; the other 3 markers were not informative. Seven (27%) of the 26 informative tumors had the same instability pattern in the surgical margins. At a median follow-up of 26 months, 5 of the 7 local recurrences occurred in patients with molecularly positive surgical margins. A strong, independent association was found between positive surgical margins and local recurrence (P = 0.01; hazard ratio, 6.49)., CONCLUSIONS: Tetranucleotide microsatellite instability in surgical margins may be a useful biomarker to predict local recurrence of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma in patients with apparently disease-free margins.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Hypoxia is a strong negative prognostic factor for all three major treatment modalities for cancer. The bioreductive drug pimonidazole is currently under clinical investigation as a hypoxia marker. In human head and neck tumors, in addition to staining patterns typical of chronic hypoxia, staining was seen specifically around areas of keratinization, raising the question of whether this is hypoxia-related. This could influence quantitative hypoxia estimates using this marker. We investigated here whether the differentiation-related staining was caused by locally high reductive enzyme levels., PATIENTS AND METHODS: The nitrotetrazolium compound NBT was used, which is reduced by nitroreductases to yield a blue color. The assay was validated on three genetically related MDA231 human mammary carcinoma cell lines: wildtype, overexpressing DT-diaphorase (DT1), and overexpressing cytochrome p450 reductase (R4). Increased NBT staining under normoxia was indeed seen for both R4 and DT1 lines. Pimonidazole staining under normoxia was only seen in the R4 line., RESULTS: Frozen tumor sections from 20 patients with head and neck cancer injected with pimonidazole were incubated with NBT. Parallel sections were stained for pimonidazole. Staining patterns were then compared on matched images, and areas of keratinization scored for the presence or absence of pimonidazole and NBT. Pimonidazole staining was seen in 56% of keratinized areas, and of these, 78% showed increased NBT staining, indicating that high reductase levels are not a necessary requirement for differentiation-associated pimonidazole staining. In a second series, frozen sections of tumors from 15 patients not receiving pimonidazole were incubated with NBT and compared with staining after incubation with pimonidazole under both oxic and hypoxic conditions. Pimonidazole staining of some keratinizing areas under oxic conditions was seen. Of these areas, only a proportion (70%) showed increased NBT staining, confirming the lack of correspondence between keratin-associated pimonidazole staining and reductase levels., CONCLUSION: Hypoxia-independent pimonidazole staining can occur in more differentiated head and neck tumors, necessitating caution in hypoxia quantification. These data argue against a causative role for locally high reductase levels in differentiation-associated staining. DT-diaphorase appears to play no role in pimonidazole reduction.

N2  - Following clinical diagnosis of a recurrent tumor, curative treatment is seldom available. Depending on the size of the recurrent tumor and the patient's general health condition extensive surgical resections and reconstructions are avoided in favor of non-surgical palliative intended treatment modalities. According to the literature location of the tumor, tumor size, as well as R-1- and R-2-resection rates are the most frequent reasons for the development of recurrent tumors. In a retrospective evaluation a population of 1000 patients who were treated for a primary head and neck cancer during the period from 1979 to 1996 were analysed descriptively. Survival probabilities of patients with recurrent tumors were calculated according to the product-limit method by Kaplan-Meier, different treatment concepts were compared and analysed with the log-rank test for significant differences. The largest proportion of primary tumors involved the floor of mouth ( n = 369, 36.9%). A total of 198 patients (19.8%) developed a recurrent cancer; 79.8% of patients experienced a recurrent cancer within two years following primary treatment. Within the group of T1/T2 tumors the incidence of recurrent tumors was 28.9%, whereas the incidence in the T3/T4 group was 44.6%. Tumor infiltration of the resection margins was detected in 12.9%. In line with the literature, tumor infiltration of the resection margins is a relevant prognostic factor, therefore intraoperative frozen section must be recommended. Treatment with curative intention, in particular extensive surgical resections, is seldom possible, and requires always a very intensive discussion with the patient.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Tumor-specific molecular alterations in surgical margins have been shown to predict risk of local recurrence. However, assays used for these analyses are time-consuming and therefore cannot be used in the intraoperative setting., OBJECTIVE: To detect and quantify tumor-specific methylated promoter sequences in surgical margins in a time frame suitable for intraoperative use., DESIGN: A novel quantitative methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (QMSP) protocol., METHODS: A total of 13 patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) were initially characterized for molecular alterations in their tumor at the time of biopsy. Six primary tumors were found to harbor promoter hypermethylation for p16 and O6-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) genes. Rapid QMSP was then used to identify promoter hypermethylation of these genes in the surgical margins. Results were compared with standard intraoperative histologic frozen section analysis and with conventional QMSP., RESULTS: Using our rapid QMSP assay, we found that 3 patients had methylation-positive margins. Tumor margins from 2 patients were methylated for p16 alone, and margins from 1 patient were methylated for p16 and MGMT simultaneously. Molecular margin analysis was completed in less than 5 hours, a time frame appropriate for selected major HNSCC resections that require combined primary tumor resection, cervical lymphadenectomy, and complex reconstruction. This technique was comparable in sensitivity to conventional QMSP., CONCLUSION: Rapid molecular margin analysis using QMSP is feasible and may be performed intraoperatively in selected patients with HNSCC that requires extensive resection.

N2  - Epigenetic silencing of the p16 and p15 genes by promoter methylation are commonly observed in human epithelial malignancies, including head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC). In this study, a methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) was used to evaluate the methylation status of the p16 and p15 genes in 73 HNSCC surgical specimens. p16 and p15 gene methylation was also examined in 29 paired metastatic lymph nodes and 29 paired histologically, normal resection margin mucosae. The quantity of cell-free methylated p16 and p15 DNA in the plasma samples of 20 HNSCC patients and 24 healthy controls was also examined using a fluorescence-based real-time PCR assay. The frequencies of p16 and p15 methylation in the primary tumour were 49% and 60%, respectively. Concordant methylation of p16 and p15 in tumour samples and metastatic lymph nodes was found in 59 and 38% of cases, respectively. A significantly higher prevalence of p15 methylation was found in histologically-normal surgical margin epithelia of HNSCC patients with chronic smoking and drinking habits compared with non-smokers and non-drinkers. In addition, methylated p16 and p15 DNA levels were significantly higher in the plasma of HNSCC patients (mean 56 copies/ml plasma and 65 copies/ml plasma, respectively) compared with normal controls (mean 6 copies/ml plasma and 16 copies/ml plasma, respectively). In conclusion, promoter methylation of the p16 and p15 genes is involved in the pathogenesis of HNSCC and may be related to chronic smoking and drinking. The differential levels of methylated p16 and p15 DNA in plasma might be potential useful markers in screening high-risk populations for early HNSCC and monitoring their treatment response.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The best treatment for advanced head and neck cancer remains unclear. Proponents of various therapeutic regimens continue to debate this issue with inconclusive and frequently biased data and with carefully selected patients in controlled trials to support their approach. To assess the outcome of patients in a real-world situation, we reviewed a prospectively maintained database of patients with head and neck cancer., METHODS: We reviewed data from 591 consecutive patients with stage III or IV squamous cell carcinoma treated at a university medical center from January 1, 1992, through December 31, 2000, and analyzed survival using the Kaplan-Meier method., RESULTS: Overall survival was 48%, 40%, and 33% at 2, 3, and 5 years, respectively. We found a significant death rate due to comorbid conditions. The primary tumor was treated surgically (with or without postoperative radiation) in 363 patients, with survival of 55%, 46%, and 38% at 2, 3, and 5 years, respectively. The tumor was treated primarily with radiation therapy (with or without neck dissection) in 193 patients, with survival of 40%, 33%, and 27% at 2, 3, and 5 years, respectively. Overall survival in the surgical group was better than in the radiation group (P =.005, log-rank chi 2 test). The radiation group was subcategorized into those who underwent radiation because the tumor was so advanced as to be unresectable (n = 86), because they were too unhealthy to undergo radical surgery (n = 23), and because they elected radiation therapy (n = 84). Survival in each of the radiation subgroups at 2, 3, and 5 years was 28%, 20%, and 14%, respectively, in the unresectable group; 34%, 22%, and 11%, respectively, in the unhealthy group; and 57%, 53%, and 46%, respectively, in the elective group. Thus, survival in the elective radiation subgroup exceeded that of the surgical group, although not statistically. We analyzed data regarding T and N stages, age, race, surgical margin status, postoperative radiation therapy, chemotherapy, radiation dose, and tumor site. Multivariate analysis of the surgical group and elective radiation subgroup showed that N stage and age were the strongest predictors of survival and that the method of therapy was not significant. For oropharyngeal cancer, the patients in the elective radiation subgroup did as well as the surgical group. Many patients were noncompliant with portions of therapy, with a resulting reduction in survival., CONCLUSIONS: The data demonstrate the value of analyzing a consecutive series of patients with advanced head and neck cancer. By including patients with comorbidities and those who are noncompliant, we determined a realistic expectation of patient outcomes. By including all patients, the data dramatically show the impact of age, comorbidity, and advanced stage on survival. The survival of patients who underwent elective radiation therapy in combination with neck dissection was similar to that of patients treated with primary tumor surgery. This was particularly true for oropharyngeal tumors. The site and stage-specific data are useful in counseling patients with advanced head and neck cancer regarding treatment choices.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether intraoperative selective lymph node sampling before neck dissection in the node-negative (N0) neck accurately reflects the disease content of the neck and can be used to assist in treatment selection., STUDY DESIGN: A prospective clinical study at a university medical center., METHODS: Over a 2-year period, 36 patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma scheduled to undergo 41 elective neck dissections were enrolled. At the initiation of the neck dissection, biopsy of the "most suspicious" lymph node within the tumor's primary nodal drainage basin was performed, and the specimen was measured and sent for frozen-section evaluation. The results of lymph node sampling were compared with the final histopathologic interpretation of the resected primary and neck dissection., RESULTS: Of the 41 N0 necks, 29% (12 of 41) were positive for occult metastases. Results of selective lymph node biopsy correlated with the results of neck dissection in 34 of 41 specimens (83%). The specificity and positive predictive value of node sampling were both 100%. The proportion of cases with a positive neck dissection with a positive sampled node (sensitivity) was 42% (5 of 12)., CONCLUSION: The results of selective lymph node biopsy with frozen-section analysis in the N0 neck, as defined in the current study, did not reflect a technique with adequate sensitivity to alter intraoperative treatment strategy.

N2  - OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Often, the type of neck dissection performed in patients with head and neck malignancy is finally determined by intraoperative assessment of clinically suspect lymph nodes by frozen section. This prospective study aimed to assess the accuracy of clinical intraoperative lymph node assessment and therefore to examine validity of the underlying assumption that the surgeon can consistently identify nodes that contain metastatic tumor. We also aimed to assess whether gross morphological characteristics of the lymph nodes examined could be correlated with nodal status and therefore used to predict those nodes containing metastatic disease., STUDY DESIGN: A prospective study assessing the accuracy of clinical intraoperative lymph node assessment in the node-negative neck., METHODS: Forty-six neck dissections from 34 patients with head and neck cancer were prospectively examined intraoperatively by a single surgeon. All obvious nodes were clinically assessed, morphologically described, and subsequently correlated with pathological findings., RESULTS: Sixty palpable nodes were identified in 32 neck dissections. They were clinically categorized as malignant or suspect (22) or benign (38). Pathological examination revealed a false-positive rate of 30% and a false-negative rate of 44%. The sensitivity of intraoperative lymph node assessment was 56%, and the specificity was 70%. Apart from "infiltration," morphological characteristics could not be correlated with nodal status. In the 14 neck dissections with no obviously palpable lymph nodes, 4 (29%) were positive for metastatic disease., CONCLUSIONS: In the node-negative neck, intraoperative assessment does not seem to improve the accuracy of staging. The only parameter of benefit and correlating with metastatic disease is clinical evidence of infiltration. The assumption that frozen section is a good determinate for selection of type of neck dissection is questionable. If selective neck dissection is not found to be therapeutic, its use leads to over-reliance on other therapeutic treatment such as postoperative radiotherapy, depriving the patient of a potential useful treatment modality in cases of locoregional recurrence.

N2  - The survival of patients with a head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma is determined by loco-regional recurrence and second primary carcinomas. As a complement to histopathology, molecular changes of tumour marginal and tumour distant tissue may confirm curative surgical tumour extirpation. We tested telomerase activity with PCR-ELISA kits.20 tumour margin biopsies were chosen by the surgeon from 20 patients. In addition, 3 tissue samples were taken from each of 20 additional patients, one from the carcinoma centre, the tumour margin and one distant from the tumour. 50% of the carcinoma centres were telomerase-positive. Thirteen of the 40 tumour margin samples showed increased telomerase levels, and in 3 of these residual carcinoma was histopathologically detected. Six of the 20 tumour distant tissues revealed increased telomerase levels. Telomerase positivity in carcinoma-free tumour margins correlated with a good prognosis. Confirmation of the results in a larger patient group is needed.

N2  - In 1953, Slaughter et al. [D. P. Slaughter et al., Cancer (Phila.), 6: 963-968, 1953] proposed the concept of field cancerization in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC) and discussed its clinical significance for the development of second primary tumors and local recurrences. To define the process of field cancerization and its putative clinical implications, we analyzed genetic aberrations in HNSCC and the accompanying macroscopically normal mucosa. In 28 HNSCC patients, loss of heterozygosity was determined in tumor and five noncontiguous mucosal biopsies using eight microsatellite markers at 9p, 3p, and 17p. For patients who showed loss of heterozygosity in their mucosal biopsies, all margins of the surgical specimen were subsequently analyzed to determine the extension of the field. In these cases, additional markers at 8p, 13q, and 18q as well as p53 mutations were included to determine subclonal differences between field and tumor. Genetically altered fields were detected in 36% (10 of 28) of the HNSCC patients. The field varied in size between patients and consisted of genetically different subclones. In 7 of 10 cases, the field extended into the surgical margins. One particular patient with a genetically altered field in a surgical margin developed a local recurrence after 28 months of follow-up. Microsatellite analysis showed that this recurrence had more molecular markers in common with the nonresected premalignant field than with the original tumor, suggesting that this persistent field has progressed further into a new malignancy. Our data show that genetically altered mucosa remains after treatment in a significant proportion of HNSCC patients, which may explain in part the high frequency of local recurrences and second primary tumors. Adequate identification and risk assessment of these genetically altered fields may have profound implications for future patient management.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: The relationship between locoregional lymph metastasis and tumor thickness in head and neck cancer has been well documented in recent years. Determining tumor thickness by frozen section may help the surgeon decide intraoperatively whether to perform elective neck dissection, whereas paraffin section results could be obtained at a later time for this decision. The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of tumor thickness measurements obtained by macroscopic measurement and by frozen section intraoperatively in laryngeal cancer., STUDY DESIGN: Prospectively we compared the tumor thickness results obtained by gross visual examination, by frozen section, and by paraffin section in 20 total, near-total, and horizontal supraglottic laryngectomy specimens., METHODS: The sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and tumor thickness was measured under a light microscope with an ocular micrometer., RESULTS: A strong correlation was found between frozen section and paraffin section tumor thickness measurements (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.993, P <.001). Paired t test showed a 4.59 mm mean difference between macroscopic and paraffin section measurements, and a 0.76 mm mean difference between frozen and paraffin section measurements., CONCLUSION: Assessment of tumor thickness in laryngeal cancer intraoperatively by frozen section is a reliable method.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Intraoperative frozen section analysis of surgical margins is widely used in head and neck cancer surgery. This study evaluates frozen section accuracy relative to permanent controls and final margins from the entire specimen, the rate at which frozen sections impact intraoperative management, and the resultant cost., STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective., METHODS: From 1997 to 1999 the frozen section results, permanent controls, and final tumor margins from 80 consecutive patients undergoing 420 intraoperative frozen section margins for head and neck malignancy were reviewed., RESULTS: A 98.3% accuracy rate (sensitivity, 88.8%; specificity, 98.9%) was found compared with permanent sections of the same tissue. However, 40% (8 of 20) of patients with positive final margins on the resection specimen, and 100% (15 of 15) with close (<5 mm) margins were not detected by frozen section analysis. The overall accuracy of frozen section in the evaluation of close or positive final margins was 71.3% (sensitivity, 34.3%; specificity, 100%). In addition, 5% (4 of 80) of patients potentially benefited from intraoperative frozen section by virtue of immediate margin revision. The estimated cost of intraoperative frozen section averaged as much as $3,123 per patient, with a cost-benefit ratio of 20:1., CONCLUSIONS: Intraoperative frozen section margins are accurate, but they are costly and cannot reliably eradicate positive final margins. Patients with early-stage lesions and those undergoing re-resection for recurrence or salvage surgery after radiation failure derived the greatest potential benefit from frozen section margins.

T1  - Incidence of unsuspected metastases in lateral cervical cysts.

Y1  - 2000//
N2  - OBJECTIVE: Solitary cystic squamous cell carcinoma metastases may be difficult to distinguish clinically from a benign cervical cyst. We sought to identify the incidence of solitary cystic squamous cell carcinoma metastasis in patients presenting with apparently benign cervical cysts., STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review., METHODS: The records of all patients who presented with isolated lateral cervical cysts between 1983 and 1999 were reviewed. Patients with a clinically apparent primary malignancy, a history of head and neck cancer, a history of irradiation, or age less than 18 years were excluded from analysis, as were patients with a histological diagnosis of nonsquamous cell malignancy or those without a final histological diagnosis., RESULTS: One hundred twenty-one adult patients presented with an initial diagnosis of lateral cervical cyst. Metastatic squamous cell carcinoma was demonstrated histologically after surgical excision in 12 patients (9.9%). The incidence of malignancy was significantly greater in patients greater than 40 years of age (23.5%, P < .0001). Results of preoperative fine-needle aspiration (FNA) were negative for malignancy in five cases of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma. Panendoscopy with directed biopsies revealed an occult primary in the base of tongue in three patients, tonsil in one patient, and nasopharynx in one. No primary was found in six patients, despite repeated examinations and close follow-up., CONCLUSIONS: Solitary cervical cysts in patients older than 40 years of age should be presumed to be carcinoma until proven otherwise. A negative FNA result may be misleading, because of hypocellularity of the cyst fluid. Excisional biopsy should be undertaken with provisions made for frozen-section analysis of the specimen and contingency panendoscopy with directed biopsies of Waldeyer's ring if frozen-section histological examination reveals malignancy.

N2  - We prospectively compared the value of MRI and clinical palpation for detecting cervical metastases in patients with primary cancer of the head and neck. Sixty patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the upper aerodigestive tract were evaluated with MRI and clinical palpation before undergoing a total of 81 neck dissections. The results of preoperative clinical palpation and MRI were compared with the histopathologic outcome. The sensitivity and specificity were 75.6% and 97.5%, respectively, for clinical palpation and 73.2% and 95%, respectively, for MRI. The rate of occult cervical metastasis was 24% with clinical palpation and 26.8% with MRI. The use of MRI did not improve the rate of early detection of occult metastasis, nor did it improve the detection of extracapsular spread. Our findings show that we could not depend on palpation or MRI alone to determine the need for elective neck dissection. However, MRI can be used to improve the preoperative grading of cervical lymph nodes. In selected cases, this may direct surgeons to convert the treatment plan to choose a more conservative neck dissection or, after sentinel node sampling and frozen-section control, to convert the treatment to a more radical dissection.

N2  - PURPOSE: To determine whether any difference in toxicity or efficacy occurs when head and neck cancer patients are treated postoperatively with (60)C0, 4 MV, or 6 MV photon beam., METHODS AND MATERIALS: This is a secondary analysis of the Intergroup Study 0034. Three hundred ninety-two patients were evaluable for comparison between treatment with (60)C0, 4 MV, or 6 MV photon beam. All patients had advanced but operable squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, or larynx. Patients were randomized following surgical resection to receive treatment with either postoperative irradiation alone, or postoperative irradiation plus three cycles of cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil. Patients were categorized as having either "low risk" or "high risk" treatment volumes based on whether the surgical margin was 5 mm or less, presence of extra capsular nodal extension, and/or carcinoma in situ at the surgical margins. Low-risk volumes received 50-54 Gy, and high-risk volumes were given 60 Gy. Patients were compared in regards to acute and late radiotherapy toxicities as well as overall survival and loco-regional control according to the beam energy used., RESULTS: One-hundred fifty-seven, 140, and 95 patients were treated by (60)C0, 4 MV, and 6 MV, respectively. No differences were seen in acute or late toxicity among treatment groups. Locoregional control was achieved in 75%, 79%, and 80% of patients treated with (60)C0, 4 MV, or 6 MV (p = 0.61). Patients treated with 6 MV had a higher incidence of ipsilateral neck failure as first event (13%) than patients treated by (60)C0 and 4 MV (9%). This difference was not statistically significant., CONCLUSION: No differences in outcome, acute, or late toxicity were discernible in patients with advanced head and neck cancer treated with (60)C0, 4 MV, or 6 MV. This result should be interpreted with caution as increased incidence, albeit nonsignificant, of ipsilateral neck recurrence was observed in patients treated with 6 MV and the power of the study to detect a statistically significant difference is small.

T1  - Induction and adjuvant chemotherapy for head and neck cancer: future perspectives.
A1  - Forastiere, A A
Y1  - 1999//
N2  - Induction and adjuvant chemotherapy have been studied in combined modality trials over the last two decades. Induction chemotherapy as a strategy has failed to improve survival or local-regional control although some studies have reported a decrease in the rate of development of distant metastases. The role of induction chemotherapy is limited to preserving the larynx for patients with larynx or hypopharynx primaries. Trials of adjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiation in resected patients suggest benefit for those with high risk features (multiple involved nodes, extracapsular extension, positive surgical margin). Definitive randomized studies are in progress in the United States and Europe. New targeted therapies will be investigated in future trials to improve survival.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Little is known about the molecular genetic events that contribute to the pathogenesis of squamous cell carcinoma of the upper aerodigestive tract. Previous molecular genetic studies have been limited to the identification of mutations of the p53 (also known as TP53) tumor suppressor gene, activation of a limited set of oncogenes, allelic loss at 3p and other locations, and occasional association with human papillomavirus infection., PURPOSE: Our purpose was to screen tumor tissue and blood from patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the upper aerodigestive tract for loss of heterozygosity at polymorphic loci corresponding to each of the autosomal chromosomes and to identify the locations of additional putative tumor suppressor genes, other than RB (also known as RB1) and p53, that may contribute to the pathogenesis of this disease., METHODS: Tumor tissue and blood were obtained from 68 consecutive patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the upper aerodigestive tract. In all cases, tumor tissue was obtained from the center of the surgical specimen. The relative absence of non-neoplastic tissue was confirmed by frozen-section histologic examination of immediately adjacent tissue. Initially, 30 paired tissue and blood samples were tested for loss of heterozygosity by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify 43 different highly polymorphic sequences containing small oligonucleotide repeats. After PCR amplification, with unique oligonucleotides flanking the repeat, visualization and sizing of the alleles on DNA sequencing gels were performed. Specific loss of heterozygosity was distinguished from random genetic loss due to generalized chromosomal instability if it occurred in more than 20% of specimens tested for a particular marker., RESULTS: Significant loss of heterozygosity (> 20%) occurred at alleles at chromosome bands 3p21 (32%), 3p25-26 (56%), 8pter-21.1 (31%), 13q14 (27%), and 17p12 (45%). Loss of heterozygosity at more than two loci was significant with a poor prognosis (P = .039)., CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that squamous cell carcinoma of the upper aerodigestive tract exhibits genetic alterations at multiple loci and that allelic loss at more than two locations is indicative of a poor prognosis (the likelihood of the patient dying of disease)., IMPLICATIONS: While tumor suppressor genes at 3p (VHL), 13q (RB), and 17p (p53) have been identified, altered genes at other loci on 3p and on 8p have not yet been characterized. Furthermore, the genotype at these loci for squamous cell carcinoma of the upper aerodigestive tract has prognostic importance and may identify the patients who should receive the most aggressive treatment.

N2  - Forty Stage IV head and neck cancer patients were entered on a multimodality trial of induction chemotherapy (cisplatin + infusional 5-fluorouracil), surgery, and radiation. During chemotherapy, the patients of Group A (the first 19 patients) were medicated with metoclopramide. The patients of Group B (the next 21 patients) were medicated with droperidol. The groups were comparable. The response rate (complete + partial) was 32% for Group A and 52% for Group B (p = 0.16). Primary site (p = 0.08) and surgical margin (p = 0.005) clearance of tumor were better in Group B. Nodal disease responded poorly to chemotherapy in both groups. Tumor necrosis (p = 0.006) and granulation tissue (p = 0.07) were reduced in surgical specimens after chemotherapy in Group B. The drugs were well tolerated with reversible toxicity; nausea/vomiting (p = 0.01) and weight loss (p = 0.07) after chemotherapy, were increased in Group B. The 2-year survival was 26% for Group A and 62% for Group B (p = 0.027). The median survival was 15 months for Group A and 33 months for Group B (p = 0.05). Progression-free survival improved in Group B (p greater than 0.17). These improvements in response and survival did not appear to reflect changes in surgical or radiotherapy management, but may have reflected an uninhibited effect of cisplatin in Group B. It is theorized that the metabisulfite formulated with metoclopramide altered the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of cisplatin. This resulted in the poor response to chemotherapy and poor survival in Group A. An analysis of a randomized trial comparing metoclopramide (formulated with metabisulfite) versus a control antiemetic can confirm the data presented in this pilot study. Overall, our patients survived as well as others in comparable multimodality studies in Europe and the United States.

N2  - One hundred thirty-four patients with advanced head and neck cancer were treated with radical surgery and postoperative radiation therapy between October 1964 and October 1984. All patients had greater than or equal to 2 years and 84% had greater than or equal to 5 years of follow-up. All patients included in the study were scheduled to receive continuous-course irradiation following a major cancer operation for previously untreated squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, or larynx and began radiation treatment less than or equal to 3 months after the surgical procedure. Ninety-six percent had AJCC pathologic Stage III or IV cancer, and all were without evidence of gross disease at the start of irradiation. The majority of recurrences above the clavicles occurred in the primary field (84%) as opposed to the posterior strip (8%) or low neck (8%). Based on multivariate analysis and tabular comparisons, 4 factors were found to be significantly important for predicting disease control above the clavicles: (a) Surgical margin (5-year actuarial control with invasive cancer at the margin, 53%, versus 81% with negative margins, p = .009). Patients with close margins or in situ cancer at the margins had the same rate of control as those with negative margins. (b) Primary site (oral cavity, 64%, versus other sites, 83%; p = .029). (c) Neck Stage (N0-1 versus N2-3). (d) Number of indications for irradiation--for example, bone invasion, multiple positive nodes, perineural invasion (1-3 indications, 85%, versus greater than or equal to 4, 62%; p = .06). The rate of disease control above the clavicles did not correlate well with AJCC pathologic stage: Stage I-II, 67%; Stage III, 81%; Stage IVA (T1-3, N2-3A), 68%; Stage IVB (T4 and/or N3B), 80%. The interval between surgery and the start of irradiation (range 1-10 weeks) also was not prognostically important, even with stratification by tumor dose, surgical margin, and number of indications for irradiation. At 5 years, the actuarial survival rate was 33% for the entire group; for patients with invasive cancer at the margin, the survival rate was approximately half that of those whose margins were free of invasive cancer (17% versus 37%). Based on multivariate analysis, 2 factors were found to significantly increase the probability of death due to cancer: (a) neck Stage (N0-1 versus N2-3); (b) extension of tumor from the primary site into the skin or soft tissues of the neck.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

N2  - Mohs surgery, as it has evolved since its inception by Mohs, is a technique for removing certain cancers using careful, precise microscopic marginal control. The contemporary technique using fresh tissue has enabled the application of Mohs surgery to the treatment of malignancies of the upper aerodigestive tract. Mohs surgery, once limited to large recurrent basal cell carcinomas, has expanded to include several cutaneous and noncutaneous neoplasms. With better understanding of the Mohs technique, its indications, applications, and advantages, an interdisciplinary approach to manage certain head and neck neoplasms is proposed.

N2  - Microscopic fingers of epidermoid cancer can extend submucosally 1 to 3 cm from grossly discernible borders of upper aerodigestive tract cancers. These fingers are best detected by sectioning all surgical margins parallel to the margins. Microscopic disease was found at the original excisional margins in 75% of 70 cases. Using this principle for frozen-section evaluation, and reexcising further tissue as indicated, local disease was completely controlled in all 24 patients eligible for two-year follow-up.
