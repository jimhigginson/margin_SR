AB  - Background: Surgical oncologists rely heavily on the histopathological assessment of surgical margins to ensure total excision of the tumor in patients with head and neck cancer. However, current techniques may not detect small numbers of cancer cells at the margins of resection or in cervical lymph nodes. Methods: We used molecular techniques to determine whether clonal populations of infiltrating tumor cells harboring mutations of the p53 gene could be detected in histopathologically negative surgical margins and cervical lymph nodes of patients with squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Results: We identified 25 patients with primary squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck containing a p53 mutation who appeared to have had complete tumor resection on the basis of a negative histopathological assessment. In 13 of these 25 patients, molecular analysis was positive for a p53 mutation in at least one tumor margin. In 5 of 13 patients with positive margins by this method (38 percent), the carcinoma has recurred locally, as compared with none of 12 patients with negative margins (P = 0.02 by the log-rank test). Furthermore, molecular analysis identified neoplastic cells in 6 of 28 lymph nodes (21 percent) that were initially negative by histopathological assessment. Conclusions: Among specimens initially believed to be negative on light microscopy, a substantial percentage of the surgical margins and lymph nodes from patients with squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck contained p53 mutations specific for the primary tumor. Patients with these positive margins appear to have a substantially increased risk of local recurrence. Molecular analysis of surgical margins and lymph nodes can augment standard histopathological assessment and may improve the prediction of local tumor recurrence., Squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck is one of the most common cancers, with a global incidence of 500,000 cases per year.1 Surgical resection is the principal treatment for the majority of advanced-stage carcinomas of the upper aerodigestive tract and a frequent choice in treating early lesions as well. The single most important prognostic factor for squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck is complete surgical removal of the neoplasm, because it is generally believed that failure to eradicate the primary tumor is the leading cause of death from this type of cancer.2–5 When gross tumor remains, local… © 1995, Massachusetts Medical Society.

AB  - Purpose: Positive margins dominate clinical outcomes after surgical resections in most solid cancer types, including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Unfortunately, surgeons remove cancer in the same manner they have for a century with complete dependence on subjective tissue changes to identify cancer in the operating room. To effect change, we hypothesize that EGFR can be targeted for safe and specific real-time localization of cancer. Experimental Design: A dose escalation study of cetuximab conjugated to IRDye800 was performed in patients (n = 12) undergoing surgical resection of squamous cell carcinoma arising in the head and neck. Safety and pharmacokinetic data were obtained out to 30 days after infusion. Multi-instrument fluorescence imaging was performed in the operating room and in surgical pathology. Results: There were no grade 2 or higher adverse events attributable to cetuximab-IRDye800. Fluorescence imaging with an intraoperative, wide-field device successfully differentiated tumor from normal tissue during resection with an average tumor-tobackground ratio of 5.2 in the highest dose range. Optical imaging identified opportunity for more precise identification of tumor during the surgical procedure and during the pathologic analysis of tissues ex vivo. Fluorescence levels positively correlated with EGFR levels. Conclusions: We demonstrate for the first time that commercially available antibodies can be fluorescently labeled and safely administered to humans to identify cancer with sub-millimeter resolution, which has the potential to improve outcomes in clinical oncology. © 2015 American Association for Cancer Research.

AB  - Background. Our aim was to investigate the ways in which surgeons who perform head and neck ablative procedures on a regular basis define margins, how they use frozen sections to evaluate margins, and the effect of chemoradiation on determining tumor margins. Methods. A custom-designed questionnaire was mailed to members of the American Head and Neck Society asking members how they evaluate and define tumor margins. Results. Of 1500 surveys mailed, 476 completed surveys were received. The most common response for distance of a clear pathologic margin was >5 mm on microscopic evaluation. A margin containing carcinoma in situ was considered a positive margin by most, but most did not consider a margin containing dysplasia a positive margin. When initial frozen section margins are positive for tumor and further resection results in negative frozen section margins, 90% consider the patient's margin negative. Most surgeons sample the frozen section from the surgical bed rather than from the main specimen. Nearly half use wider margins when resecting tumors treated with neoadjuvant therapy. When resecting recurrent or residual tumors treated with previous chemoradiation therapy, most resect to the pretreatment margin. Conclusions. No uniform criteria to define a clear surgical margin exist among practicing head and neck surgeons. Most head and neck surgeons consider margins clear if resection completed after an initial positive frozen section margin reveals negative margins, but this view is not shared by all. Most surgeons take frozen sections from the surgical bed; however, error may occur when identifying the positive margin within the surgical bed. The definition of a clear tumor margin after chemoradiation is unclear. These questions could be addressed in a multicenter prospective trial. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Adequate resection margins are critical to the treatment decisions and prognosis of patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). However, there are numerous controversies regarding reporting and interpretation of the status of resection margins. Fundamental issues relating to the basic definition of margin adequacy, uniform reporting standards for margins, optimal method of specimen dissection, and the role of intraoperative frozen section evaluation, all require further clarification and standardization. Future horizons for margin surveillance offer the possible use of novel methods such as "molecular margins" and contact microscopic endoscopy, However, the limitations of these approaches need to be understood. The goal of this review was to evaluate these issues to define a more rational, standardized approach for achieving resection margin adequacy for patients with HNSCC undergoing curative resection. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Standardised reporting of head and neck cancer resections according to guidelines issued by the UK Royal College of Pathologists was introduced as a routine procedure in 1998. The guidelines include definitions of "mucosal", "deep", "clear", "close" and "involved" surgical margins. This study of routine diagnostic material describes the frequency, type and morphological features of involved margins, and assesses the influence of tumour site and pathological T and N stage. 301 consecutive radical resection specimens for oral/oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma assessed according to the guidelines were appraised. 70 resections (23%) had involved margins. The frequency was related to primary tumour site, and pathological T and N stage. Mucosal involvement was evident in 11 resections, bone in 10, and deep soft tissue in 61-12 resections had multiple category involvement. Both anatomical factors and histological "markers" of tumour characteristics influence the status of surgical resection margins. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to comprehensively review overall survival, functional outcomes, and prognostic factors in patients who underwent salvage surgery for locally recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx (SCCOP) after initial radiotherapy. METHODS: The authors retrospectively reviewed 1681 consecutive patients who completed definitive therapy for primary SCCOP and identified 168 patients with locally recurrent SCCOP who underwent salvage surgery (41 patients), reirradiation or brachytherapy (18 patients), palliative chemotherapy (70 patients), or supportive care (39 patients). RESULTS: Twenty-six of 39 patients (67%) developed a second recurrence after salvage surgery. The 3-year overall survival rate for patients who underwent salvage surgery or received reirradiation, palliative chemotherapy, or supportive care were 48.7%, 31.6%, 3.7%, and 5.1%, respectively. For patients who underwent salvage surgery, older age (P = .03), the absence of a disease-free interval (P < .01), and advanced recurrent tumor stage (P = .07) were associated with lower overall survival. Patients with recurrent neck disease (P = .01) and positive surgical margins (P = .04) had higher rates of recurrence after salvage surgery. Postoperative complications occurred in 19 patients (46%), and there were no perioperative deaths. Functionally, 71% of patients demonstrated ≥80% speech intelligibility, 68% were able to tolerate some oral intake, and 87% who required a tracheotomy subsequently were decannulated. CONCLUSIONS: Age, disease-free interval, recurrent tumor stage, recurrent neck disease, and surgical margin status influenced overall survival or recurrence rate after salvage surgery for recurrent SCCOP. Although most patients had good functional outcomes, only a select group of patients with recurrent SCCOP achieved long-term survival after salvage surgery. © 2009 American Cancer Society.

AB  - Purpose: Approximately 10-30% of surgically treated head and neck cancer patients develop local recurrences while the resection margins are histologically tumor free. These recurrences may arise from cancer cells left behind but not detected by the pathologist, or they may develop from precursor lesions adjacent to the tumor that were not completely resected. We have investigated whether TP53-mutated DNA in the surgical margins is suitable to identify patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma at risk for local and locoregional recurrence. Experimental Design: In a prospective cohort study of 76 patients with histologically tumor-free margins, the presence of TP53-mutated DNA was determined in the surgical margins using the phage plaque assay and correlated to clinical outcome. Immunostaining of the molecular-positive margins for mutated p53 protein was used to identify whether unresected precursor lesions or residual tumor cells were left behind. Results: The absence of TP53-mutated DNA in surgical margins was significantly associated with remaining free of local and locoregional recurrence (P = 0.027 and P = 0.028, respectively). Moreover, the presence of TP53-mutated DNA in the surgical margins was an independent prognosticator for locoregional recurrence (relative risk = 7.1; P = 0.021; 95% confidence interval, 0.9-56). In 20% of the cases, the presence of TP53-mutated DNA in the surgical margins was found to be related to the presence of tumor-related precursor lesions. Conclusions: This study shows the value of TP53-mutated DNA as a molecular marker to predict locally recurrent head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. The observation that all patients who were negative for TP53-mutated DNA in the surgical margins remained free of local recurrence raises hope that molecular analysis of histologically tumor-free surgical margins can be exploited to decide on postoperative radiotherapy. Furthermore, our data provide evidence that local recurrences originate mainly from tumor cells left behind but also originate, in part, from unresected precursor lesions.

AB  - Conventional methods for histopathologic tissue diagnosis are labor- and time-intensive and can delay decision-making during diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. We report the development of an automated and biocompatible handheld mass spectrometry device for rapid and nondestructive diagnosis of human cancer tissues. The device, named MasSpec Pen, enables controlled and automated delivery of a discrete water droplet to a tissue surface for efficient extraction of biomolecules. We used the MasSpec Pen for ex vivo molecular analysis of 20 human cancer thin tissue sections and 253 human patient tissue samples including normal and cancerous tissues from breast, lung, thyroid, and ovary. The mass spectra obtained presented rich molecular profiles characterized by a variety of potential cancer biomarkers identified as metabolites, lipids, and proteins. Statistical classifiers built from the histologically validated molecular database allowed cancer prediction with high sensitivity (96.4%), specificity (96.2%), and overall accuracy (96.3%), as well as prediction of benign and malignant thyroid tumors and different histologic subtypes of lung cancer. Notably, our classifier allowed accurate diagnosis of cancer in marginal tumor regions presenting mixed histologic composition. Last, we demonstrate that the MasSpec Pen is suited for in vivo cancer diagnosis during surgery performed in tumor-bearing mouse models, without causing any observable tissue harm or stress to the animal. Our results provide evidence that the MasSpec Pen could potentially be used as a clinical and intraoperative technology for ex vivo and in vivo cancer diagnosis.

AB  - Despite substantial improvements in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) treatment, the major obstacle to long-term survival remains disease recurrence. Salvage options are often limited due to prior therapy and the escalated morbidity of retreatment. The costs of treatment must be measured against the anticipated quality and quantity of life recovered, even with resectable disease. This review surveys the recurrent HNSCC literature to better guide decision making. Across multiple studies, negative prognostic factors include impaired performance status, advanced recurrent stage, brief disease-free interval, previous chemotherapy, and nonlaryngeal sites of recurrence. When possible, surgical salvage remains the principal option for durable disease control, quality of life preservation, and cure. Nonsurgical therapies have also demonstrated measurable improvements in locoregional control. Interpretation of salvage literature must be tempered by recognition of significant selection bias. The decision for salvage therapy must be individualized, with management that involves well-informed patients resulting in the best outcomes. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Objectives: Intraoperative frozen section analysis of surgical margins is widely used in head and neck cancer surgery. This study evaluates frozen section accuracy relative to permanent controls and final margins from the entire specimen, the rate at which frozen sections impact intraoperative management, and the resultant cost. Study Design: Retrospective. Methods: From 1997 to 1999 the frozen section results, permanent controls, and final tumor margins from 80 consecutive patients undergoing 420 intraoperative frozen section margins for head and neck malignancy were reviewed. Results: A 98.3% accuracy rate (sensitivity, 88.8%; specificity, 98.9%) was found compared with permanent sections of the same tissue. However, 40% (8 of 20) of patients with positive final margins on the resection specimen, and 100% (15 of 15) with close (<5 mm) margins were not detected by frozen section analysis. The overall accuracy of frozen section in the evaluation of close or positive final margins was 71.3% (sensitivity, 34.3%; specificity, 100%). In addition, 5% (4 of 80) of patients potentially benefited from intraoperative frozen section by virtue of immediate margin revision. The estimated cost of intraoperative frozen section averaged as much as $3123 per patient, with a cost-benefit ratio of 20:1. Conclusions: Intraoperative frozen section margins are accurate, but they are costly and cannot reliably eradicate positive final margins. Patients with early-stage lesions and those undergoing re-resection for recurrence or salvage surgery after radiation failure derived the greatest potential benefit from frozen section margins.

AB  - The sinonasal cavities represent an anatomical region affected by a variety of tumours with clinical, aetiological, pathological, and genetic features distinct from tumours at the main head and neck cancer localizations. Together, squamous-cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma account for 80% of all sinonasal tumours, and are aetiologically associated with professional exposure to wood and leather dust particles and other industrial compounds, and therefore, are officially recognized as an occupational disease. Owing to their distinctive characteristics, sinonasal tumours should be considered as separate entities, not to be included in the miscellany of head and neck cancers. Sinonasal tumours are rare, with an annual incidence of approximately 1 case per 100,000 inhabitants worldwide, a fact that has hampered molecular-genetic studies of the tumorigenic pathways and the testing of alternative treatment strategies. Nevertheless, the clinical management of sinonasal cancer has improved owing to advances in imaging techniques, endoscopic surgical approaches, and radiotherapy. Genetic profiling and the development of in vitro cell lines and animal models currently form the basis for future targeted anticancer therapies. We review these advances in our understanding and treatment of sinonasal tumours. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.

AB  - Expression of activated MMP-2 (72 kDA type IV collagenase) is highly associated with the malignant phenotype in adenocarcinomas, but predominant expression of the mRNA appears to be in stromal cells. MT1-MMP (membrane type 1-matrix metalloproteinase) is implicated in tumor-epithelial cell surface activation of latent pro-MMP-2, indicating a mechanism for tumor-stromal interaction in invasion. We determined the relative mRNA distribution of these MMPs in human ovarian tumors with a view to analyzing potential variations in the epithelial-mesenchymal interactions dictating ovarian tumor cell spread. In situ hybridization using 35S-labaled riboprobes was used to analyze 33 human ovarian tumors and mouse xenografts of human ovarian (DOVB 13, SKOV 3) and breast (MCF7) tumor cell lines known to express MT1-MMP and MMP-2. MMP-2 mRNA was expressed in 31 of 33 and MT1-MMP mRNA was expressed in 29 of 33 tumor cases. MMP-2 mRNA was predominantly stroma. MT1-MMP mRNA showed some colocalization with MMP-2 in stromal cells. Neoplastic epithelial cell labeling for MT1-MMP mRNA was present in borderline and malignant tumors but not in benign tumors, and was invariably less than stromal labeling. Xenografts of DOV 13, SKOV 3, and MCF 7 cells showed some stromal localization of MMP-2 mRNA and weak labeling of DOV 13 cells. There was variable labeling for MT1-MMP mRNA in the neoplastic cells only. The colocalization of MT1-MMP and MMP-2 mRNAs in ovarian carcinoma stroma supports the view that MT1-MMP is closely associated with MMP-2 expression and function. It suggests that either additional mechanisms are involved in regulating MMP-2 activation at the tumor cell surface, or more intriguingly, that desmoplastic fibroplasts may be the primary mediators of extracellular matrix remodeling with respect to this system.

AB  - Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is characterized by high mortality rates. High incidence of local recurrences in the normal-appearing surgical margins of OSCC patients indicates the existence molecular alterations, including DNA methylation, which could not be detectable by histopathologic analysis. The objective of our study was to determine correlation of tumor-related genes hypermethylation detected in histopathologically negative surgical margins with clinical and prognostic parameters. The genes selected for methylation analysis covered a wide range cellular processes including cell cycle control (p16), apoptosis (DAPK and RASSF1A), Wnt signaling (APC, WIF1 and RUNX3), cell-cell adhesion (E-cad), and DNA repair (MGMT and hMLH1). All of 47 patients had histologically confirmed negative surgical margins. For each of patient, samples from primary malignant tissue and the two consecutive surgical margins were taken at the time of surgery. DNA methylation was determined by multiplex nested methylation-specific PCR. Twenty-seven patients were margin-positive for promoter hypermethylation of at least one gene under study. The presence of DAPK promoter hypermethylation detected in surgical margins was associated with the decreased overall survival (p = 0.004, log rank test). Multivariate analysis revealed that DAPK promoter hypermethylation in surgical margins is an independent prognostic factor for overall survival, HR = 4.105 (1.458-11.555, 95% CI, p = 0.007). Hypermethylation of other tumor-related genes under study did not have prognostic significance. These results demonstrate that DNA hypermethylation in histologically negative surgical margins is a frequent event. Promoter hypermethylation of DAPK gene detected in surgical margins may be a useful molecular marker for the poor survival in OSCC patients. Further investigation into the therapeutic potential of these findings in OSCC is warranted. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - BACKGROUND. Negative resection margins are likely the most important prognostic factor for a patient with a head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Frozen-section evaluation allows a positive margin to be corrected before surgical closure and reconstruction. A final pathology report is later issued after examination of all resected tissues. The accuracy of the final pathology report relies on accuracy in the preceding steps. The current process of margin reporting in head and neck cancer resections was studied to reveal possible waste and error in the system. METHODS. Two hundred pathologists were surveyed about their center's current process of frozen-section margin evaluation. The authors of the current study used the membership log of the North American Society of Head and Neck Pathology and the list of the top 50 US cancer centers according to US News and World Report. The authors analyzed the process of frozen-section procedure using Toyota industry principles of quality improvement. RESULTS. The majority of surgeons send small fragments of tissue from the surgical defect cavity. Many pathologists receive small unoriented tissue fragments. Many resample all or most of the margins for the final pathology report without anatomic orientation from the surgeon. Other pathologists do not sample any margins. CONCLUSIONS. Final margin reporting redundancy and waste is due mainly to lack of anatomic correlation at interdisciplinary hand-offs. Oversampling and undersampling of margins may be occurring, and the accuracy of the final pathology report may be compromised. There is currently no consensus on how to best submit tissue for frozen-section evaluation of head and neck resection margins. © 2006 American Cancer Society.

AB  - The relatively modest survival of patients surgically treated for advanced HNSCC can partly be explained by the development of local relapse. It is important that surgeons are able to predict which patients are at high risk to develop local relapse, since clinical management can be tailored. Local relapse after resection of a primary HNSCC is easily explained, when tumour is detected in the surgical margins and thus residual tumour is likely to remain in the patient, but the pathobiology is more complex in cases where the margins are histologically tumour-free. Molecular studies indicate that there are two different mechanisms responsible in these cases. First, small clusters of residual tumour cells that are undetectable on routine histopathological examination (known as minimal residual cancer: MRC) proliferate and this forms the basis of recurring cancer. A second cause of relapse is a remaining field of preneoplastic cells that is struck by additional genetic hits leading to invasive cancer. It is likely that within this field, that can be over 7 cm in diameter, the primary carcinoma has also emerged. Despite careful histopathological examination of the surgical margins of the primary carcinoma, it is at present not reliably possible to predict which patient will develop local relapse. Herein we focus on new developments regarding the analysis of margins, causes of local relapse, and how novel molecular techniques can be of help in a more accurate risk assessment. Critical analysis of the studies that have been published thus far shows that there is a list of promising markers, based on protein expression (immuno-histochemistry) and nucleic acid analysis. Further studies should be focused on validation and assessment of the clinical utility of these markers. Margin analysis should reveal whether one is dealing with residual cancer cells that might be treated by post-operative radiotherapy or with preneoplastic fields that remained behind. For this latter entity, there is no intervention available at present, except for a more intensive surveillance. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: The high rate of positive margins after transoral laser microsurgery (TLM) remains a matter of debate. This study investigates the effect of intraoperative narrow band imaging (NBI) examination on the incidence of positive superficial surgical margins in early glottic cancer treated by TLM. Methods: Between January 2012 and October 2013, 82 patients affected by Tis-T1a glottic cancer were treated with TLM by type I or II cordectomies. Intraoperative NBI evaluation was performed using 0-degree and 70-degree rigid telescopes. Surgical specimens were oriented by marking the superior edge with black ink and sent to a dedicated pathologist. Comparison between the rate of positive superficial margins in the present cohort and in a matched historical control group treated in the same way without intraoperative NBI was calculated by chi-square test. Results: At histopathological examination, all surgical margins were negative in 70 patients, whereas 7 had positive deep margins, 2 close, and 3 positive superficial margins. The rate of positive superficial margins was thus 3.6% in the present group and 23.7% in the control cohort (P <.001). Conclusion: Routine use of intraoperative NBI increases the accuracy of neoplastic superficial spreading evaluation during TLM for early glottic cancer. © The Author(s) 2014.

AB  - In early-stage breast cancer, the primary treatment option for most women is breast-conserving surgery (BCS). There is a clear need for more accurate techniques to assess resection margins intraoperatively, because on average 20% of patients require further surgery to achieve clear margins. Cerenkov luminescence imaging (CLI) combines optical and molecular imaging by detecting light emitted by 18F-FDG. Its high-resolution and small size imaging equipment make CLI a promising technology for intraoperative margin assessment. A first-in-human study was conducted to evaluate the feasibility of 18F-FDG CLI for intraoperative assessment of tumor margins in BCS. Methods: Twenty-two patients with invasive breast cancer received 18F-FDG (5 MBq/kg) 45-60 min before surgery. Sentinel lymph node biopsy was performed using an increased 99mTc-nanocolloid activity of 150 MBq to facilitate nodal detection against the g-probe background signal (cross-talk) from 18F-FDG. The cross-talk and 99mTc dose required was evaluated in 2 lead-in studies. Immediately after excision, specimens were imaged intraoperatively in an investigational CLI system. The first 10 patients were used to optimize the imaging protocol; the remaining 12 patients were included in the analysis dataset. Cerenkov luminescence images from incised BCS specimens were analyzed postoperatively by 2 surgeons blinded to the histopathology results, and mean radiance and margin distance were measured. The agreement between margin distance on CLI and histopathology was assessed. Radiation doses to staff were measured. Results: Ten of the 12 patients had an elevated tumor radiance on CLI. Mean radiance and tumor-to-background ratio were 560 6 160 photons/s/cm2/sr and 2.41 6 0.54, respectively. All 15 assessable margins were clear on CLI and histopathology. The agreement in margin distance and interrater agreement was good (k 5 0.81 and 0.912, respectively). Sentinel lymph nodes were successfully detected in all patients. The radiation dose to staff was low; surgeons received a mean dose of 34 6 15 mSv per procedure. Conclusion: Intraoperative 18F-FDG CLI is a promising, low-risk technique for intraoperative assessment of tumor margins in BCS. A randomized controlled trial will evaluate the impact of this technique on reexcision rates. © 2017 by the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging.

AB  - The aim of this systematic review is to evaluate the definition of close margin in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), and its possible prognostic significance. An appropriate string was run on PubMed to retrieve articles discussing the 'close' surgical margin issue in HNSCC. A double cross-check was performed on citations and full-text articles retrieved. In total, 348 articles were identified. Further references were included by using the option "Titles in your search terms" option in PubMed. 15 papers were finally included for qualitative synthesis. In vocal cord surgery of HNSCC, a close margin could be considered to be ≤1 mm, in the larynx ≤5 mm, in the oral cavity ≤4 mm, and in the oropharynx ≤5 mm. In each patient, the choice of extent of close margin should be balanced against general condition, tumor stage, and functional issues to indicate appropriate adjuvant therapy. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Objectives/Hypothesis Evaluate effectiveness of resection of oral cavity cancer with a standardized approach for margin evaluation. Primary end points were local control and survival. Study Design Retrospective, nonrandomized, single institution. Methods One hundred eight patients who underwent surgery for oral cancer were evaluated using specific anatomical pathology criteria. Frozen section was performed with the surgeon and pathologist agreeing where on the specimen the frozen sections should be taken in most cases. Results Ninety-one patients (84.3%) had frozen sections taken from the specimen, eight from the tumor bed, and nine had none taken at the time of surgery. Overall local recurrence rate was 18.5%, 25% in patients who had margins taken from the tumor bed and 17.6% when taken from the specimen. Twenty-nine patients had margins ≥5 mm, 53 <5 mm and clear, and 14 positive re-resected to negative with local recurrence rates of 3.4%, 26.4%, and 28.6%, respectively. The radial distance of the resection margin was shown to have an impact on overall survival (hazard ratio [HR] = 3.59, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.12-11.57), disease-free survival (HR = 7.00, 95% CI = 1.89-25.95), and local recurrence-free survival (HR = 28.80, 95% CI = 3.00-276.82). Conclusions Assessing margins from the resection specimen rather than the tumor bed consistently predicts local control. There is a statistical improvement in local control, disease-free, and overall survival with increasing radial margin distance from the tumor, and 5 mm should be agreed upon as the definition of a clear resection margin. Frozen sections can be used to revise positive or close resection margins intraoperatively with improved outcomes. © 2015 The American Laryngological, Rhinological and Otological Society, Inc.

AB  - IMPORTANCE Resection of the primary tumor with negative margins is the gold standard treatment for squamous cell carcinoma of the oral tongue (SCCOT). A microscopically positive surgical margin is clearly associated with a higher risk for local recurrence, whereas a negative margin has traditionally been defined as greater than 5.0mmclearance from the tumor, with lesser margins arbitrarily designated as close. The precise cutoff at which the risk for local recurrence with a close margin approximates that of a microscopically positive margin remains unclear. OBJECTIVE To determine whether the arbitrarily defined close margin (<5.0 mm) would portend as high a risk for local recurrence as a positive margin after resection of SCCOT. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this retrospective study, head and neck pathologists reviewed archived tumor specimens from 381 patients with SCCOT who underwent primary surgical resection at a tertiary care center from January 1, 2000, through December 31, 2012. Data were analyzed from November 15, 2015, to January 5, 2016. Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used in patients who did not have a microscopically positive margin to determine an optimal margin cutoff for local recurrence-free survival (LRFS). Pathologic factors were assessed for LRFS in a multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary end pointwas evaluation of the margin distance associated with LRFS. RESULTS Among the 381 patients included in the analysis (222 men [58.3%] and 159 women [41.7%]; mean [SD] age, 58 [14.7] years), the optimal cutoff associated with LRFS was determined to be 2.2 mm. This cutoff was compared with the traditionally accepted cutoff of 5.0 mm. Patients with a margin of 2.3 to 5.0mmhad similar LRFS as patients with a margin of greater than 5.0mm(hazard ratio [HR], 1.31; 95%CI, 0.58-2.96), and all other comparisons were significantly different (HR for positive margin, 9.03; 95%CI, 3.45-23.67; HR for 0.01- to 2.2-mm margin, 2.83; 95%CI, 1.32-6.07). Based on this result, negative margins were redefined as those with a clearance of greater than 2.2 mm. In a multivariate model adjusting for pathologic factors, positive margins (adjusted HR, 5.73; 95%CI, 2.45-13.41) and margins of 0.01 to 2.2mm(adjusted HR, 2.00; 95%CI, 1.13-3.55) were the variables most significantly associated with LRFS. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this study, local recurrence-free survival was significantly affected only with surgical margins of less than or equal to 2.2mmin patients with SCCOT. This new definition of close margins stratifies the risk for local recurrence better than the arbitrary 5.0-mm cutoff that has been used. © 2017 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.

AB  - A major problem in head and neck cancer surgery is the high rate of local relapse (LR). In at least 25% of the surgically treated head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients, a genetically defined preneoplastic lesion, also known as "field," can be detected in the surgical margins. A remaining field may be an important cause for the development of LR. The aims of our study are (i) to investigate whether HNSCC patients with an unresected field are more likely to develop LR, and (ii) to identify molecular risk factors that predict malignant transformation of field. We retrospectively studied 35 HNSCC patients of whom 16 patients developed LR and 19 patients remained disease-free for at least 4 years. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at chromosomes 3p, 9p and 17p, p53 immunostaining, Ki-67 immunostaining and histopathological grading of all available paraffin-embedded surgical margins was performed, and related to LR. Significant associations were determined by Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox-proportional hazard models. We show that presence of field is significantly associated with LR and that LOH at 9p and p53 immunostaining have the most predictive potential (hazard ratios 3.17 and 3.46, and p values 0.027 and 0.017, respectively). The combination of LOH at 9p and/or a large p53 positive field is most predictive (hazard ratio 7.06 and p = 0.01). Presence and grade of dysplasia was not associated with LR. These data may have major impact for future diagnostic workup of surgically treated HNSCC patients. © 2010 UICC.

AB  - Purpose The surgical margin is the main prognostic factor over which the surgeon has control during resection of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). This study examined the association between surgical excision margins of patients with OSCC and outcomes of disease-free and overall survival. Materials and Methods The authors implemented a retrospective cohort study. The sample was composed of patients with OSCC having resection as their initial treatment. The predictor variable was the pathologic surgical margin, defined as clear (>5 mm), close (1 to 5 mm), or involved (<1 mm). The outcome variables were disease-free (absence of locoregional recurrence) and overall survival. Data were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox regression hazard model. Results The sample was composed of 54 patients with a mean age of 60.5 years (range, 19 to 85 yr) and 26% were women. The 2- and 5-year overall survival rates were 59 and 50%, respectively. The clear surgical margin group showed higher disease-free survival rates than patients with close and involved margins (5-yr probability, 0.78 vs 0.43 and 0.29; P =.014) and a trend toward increased overall survival at 2 and 5 years (P =.093). Conclusion The results suggest that the presence of a close surgical margin (1 to 5 mm) is an adverse risk feature comparable to an involved margin and therefore is associated with decreased disease-free and overall survival. Future studies are needed to replicate these findings before they can be used as a basis for clinical recommendations. © 2015 American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.

AB  - The poor prognosis of oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OCSCC) patients is associated with residual tumor after surgery. Raman spectroscopy has the potential to provide an objective intra-operative evaluation of the surgical margins. Our aim was to understand the discriminatory basis of Raman spectroscopy at a histological level. In total, 127 pseudo-color Raman images were generated from unstained thin tissue sections of 25 samples (11 OCSCC and 14 healthy) of 10 patients. These images were clearly linked to the histopathological evaluation of the same sections after hematoxylin and eosin-staining. In this way, Raman spectra were annotated as OCSCC or as a surrounding healthy tissue structure (i.e., squamous epithelium, connective tissue (CT), adipose tissue, muscle, gland, or nerve). These annotated spectra were used as input for linear discriminant analysis (LDA) models to discriminate between OCSCC spectra and healthy tissue spectra. A database was acquired with 88 spectra of OCSCC and 632 spectra of healthy tissue. The LDA models could distinguish OCSCC spectra from the spectra of adipose tissue, nerve, muscle, gland, CT, and squamous epithelium in 100%, 100%, 97%, 94%, 93%, and 75% of the cases, respectively. More specifically, the structures that were most often confused with OCSCC were dysplastic epithelium, basal layers of epithelium, inflammation- and capillary-rich CT, and connective and glandular tissue close to OCSCC. Our study shows how well Raman spectroscopy enables discrimination between OCSCC and surrounding healthy tissue structures. This knowledge supports the development of robust and reliable classification algorithms for future implementation of Raman spectroscopy in clinical practice. © 2015 USCAP, Inc All rights reserved.

AB  - The development of locoregional recurrence is the main reason for treatment failure in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) and the remaining of tumor cells in surgical margins is associated with recurrence. Surgical margins are considered negative based on histologic assessment of the pathological specimen. However, this method lacks sensitivity in identifying cells that already started malignant transformation but have not yet developed a pathologic phenotype. We investigated the usefulness of assessing the expression of PTHLH, EPCAM, MMP9, LGALS1 and MET for the detection of molecular alterations in histologically negative surgical margins and determine the correlation of these tumor-related alterations with clinical and prognostic parameters. Differential gene expression was determined by quantitative RT-PCR analyses in normal mucosa, HNSCC and negative margin samples. Thirty-eight percent of the histologically negative surgical margins examined were margin-positive for overexpression of at least one of the genes evaluated. Moreover, MMP9 and PTHLH overexpression in the surgical margins was associated with the development of second primary tumors (p = 0.002) and lower rates of local control (log rank test p = 0.022; HR = 4.186; p = 0.035), respectively. These findings demonstrate that the overexpression of tumor-related genes in histologically negative surgical margins is a frequent event. The use of qRT-PCR may be an useful tool in detecting actually negative HNSCC surgical margins and the overexpression of specific genes in these margins could be helpful in the identification of patients with a higher risk of developing second primary tumors and local recurrences, thus aiding the surgeon in the delineation of the HNSCC resection extent and helping in the planning of adjuvant therapy. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Objective: This study looked at the independent impact of intraoperative frozen section assessment of the adequacy of margins of excision on disease control and survival. Study design: The design was a review of outcome of historical cohort of 416 surgically treated oral cancer patients at a comprehensive cancer center. Status of the margins at permanent sections, disease failure at the primary site, and survival data of 229 patients who had frozen sections were compared by univariate and multivariate analysis with 197 patients who did not have frozen sections. Results: Failure at the primary site was independently influenced by age at diagnosis (P < .001), T stage (P = .016), N stage (P = .042), and status of margins on paraffin sections (P = .005). Chance of achieving clear margins on paraffin sections was, however, not significantly improved by the use of frozen sections. On multivariate analysis, the use of frozen sections did not independently have an impact on local failure or survival. Conclusions: Frozen section assessment of mucosal margins has not improved the disease outcome. Crown Copyright © 2009.

AB  - Objectives The treatment strategy of early stage oral squamous cell carcinoma's (OSCC) resected with close or involved margins is a returning point of discussion. In this study we reviewed the consequences of re-resection (RR), postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) or watchful waiting (WW). Patients and methods Two-hundred patients with a primary resected Stage 1-2 OSCC of the tongue, floor of the mouth and cheek were included and retrospectively analysed. Local recurrence ratio was related to margin status, unfavourable histological parameters (spidery infiltrative, peri-neural and vascular-invasive growth) and postoperative treatment modality. 3-year overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) was calculated in relation to margin status. Results Twenty-two of 200 (11%) patients had pathological positive margins (PM), 126 (63%) close margins (CM), and 52 (26%) free margins (FM). OS and DSS were not significantly different between these groups. Nine of 200 (4.5%) patients developed local recurrent disease. Two (9.1%) had a PM, five (4.0%) a CM and two (3.8%) a FM. Of the nine recurrences, five patients had undergone PORT, one a RR, and three follow-up. Watchful waiting for CM ≥3 mm with ≤2 unfavourable histological parameters showed, besides margin status no significant differences with the FM group. Conclusion With this treatment strategy, the local recurrence rate was 4.5%. No evidence was found for local adjuvant treatment in case of close margins ≥3 mm with ≤2 unfavourable histological parameters. Current data do not support the use of one treatment modality above any other. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background A positive margin is among the most significant factors that affects the outcome in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). The purpose of this study was to compare the negative margin rates between 2 methods of intraoperative margin assessment in patients with oral cavity SCC. Methods A prospective, randomized controlled trial comparing 2 methods of intraoperative margin assessment: specimen-driven margins and patient-driven margins. Results The final analysis included 71 patients, 20 (29%) in the patient-driven margin arm. Frozen section analysis revealed positive/close surgical margins that led to an extension of the surgical resection in 22 of 51 patients (43%) in the specimen-driven margin arm, and 2 of 20 patients (10%) in the patient-driven margin arm (p =.01). After final pathological analysis, the wide negative margin rate was 84% in the specimen-driven margin arm, compared to 55% in the patient-driven margin arm (p =.02). Extension of the surgical resection prevented escalation of adjuvant treatment in 19 patients (38%) in the specimen-driven margin arm and 10% in the patient-driven margin arm. Conclusion Specimen derived margin assessment led to significant improvement in the rate of negative margins. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc..

AB  - Background: Incomplete surgical removal of cancer is believed to be the main cause of local recurrence and high mortality. This study assessed the use of optical technology (namely optical coherence tomography [OCT]) in examining oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) resection margins to assess if this modality could guide the surgeon during surgical resections. Materials and methods: Twenty-eight T1-T2 N0M0 oral squamous cell carcinoma patients participated in this study. Nineteen patients were males and nine were females. The majority of lesions were in the ventro-lateral tongue, floor of mouth, retromolar trigone and the buccal mucosa.Following tumour resection, the specimen resection margins were optically scanned in the immediate ex vivo phase. Two independent assessors commented on the four resection margins of each specimen. The findings were then compared to the corresponding gold standard histopathology. The average epithelial thickness for both tumor-free and tumor-involved margins was also calculated. Results: The pathology reports of the 112 margins revealed 90 tumor-free margins and 22 tumor-involved margins. Examining the data from both senior operating surgeons (assessors), the overall sensitivity and specificity was found to be 81.5% and 87%, respectively. Whilst the positive predictive value was 61.5% and the negative predictive value was 95%. OCT accuracy for the first assessor was 88% and for the second assessor 84%. The assessors' inter-observer agreement was "very good" for superior, inferior and medial margins; while agreement on the lateral surgical margin status was "good". Using OCT, the mean epithelial thickness at the tumor-free resection margins was 360 μm; while, it was 567 μm for the tumour-involved margins. Conclusion: OCT is a valuable tool in the assessment of surgical margins. Tumour-involved margins can be identified by architectural changes and increase in epithelial layer thickness on the OCT image. Further studies are required to assess tumour margins in vivo. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - BACKGROUND Securing negative surgical margins is a critical goal for head and neck surgery. Local recurrence develops even in some patients who have histologically negative surgical margins. Minimal residual tumor cells may lead to locoregional recurrence despite clear histologic margins reported at the time of resection of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). To identify subclinical residual disease, the authors analyzed deep margin imprint samples collected on 1-layer nitrocellulose sheets. METHODS Bisulfite-treated DNA samples from 73 eligible patients were amplified by quantitative methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (QMSP) targeting 6 genes (deleted in colorectal cancer [DCC], endothelin receptor type B [EDNRB], homeobox protein A9 [HOXA9], kinesin family member 1A [KIF1A], nidogen-2 [NID2], and N-methyl D-aspartate receptor subtype 2B [NR2B]). QMSP values were dichotomized as positive or negative. Associations between the QMSP status of deep margin samples and clinical outcomes were evaluated. RESULTS Two-gene methylation combinations among the genes DCC, EDNRB, and HOXA9 were associated with decreased locoregional recurrence-free survival, recurrence-free survival, and overall survival. The methylated gene combination of EDNRB and HOXA9 in margin imprints was the most powerful predictor of poor locoregional recurrence-free survival (hazard ratio [HR], 3.31; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.30-8.46; P = .012) independent of standard histologic factors. In addition, methylation of both EDNRB and HOXA9 indicated a trend toward reduced recurrence-free survival (HR, 2.74; 95% CI, 0.90-8.33; P = .075) and reduced OS (HR, 5.78; 95% CI, 0.75-44.7; P = .093) in multivariable analysis. CONCLUSIONS A panel of gene methylation targets in deep surgical margin imprints provides a potential predictive marker of postoperative locoregional recurrence. Intraoperative use of molecular margin imprint analysis may assist surgeons in obtaining rigorously negative surgical margins and improve the outcome of head and neck surgery.

AB  - Importance The prevalence of genetically altered cells in oral cancers has a negative influence on the locoregional recurrence rate and lowers survival. Fluorescence visualization (FV) can identify clinically occult, high-risk oral lesions by allowing health care professionals and surgeons to visualize and map occult disease. This process may improve overall survival by decreasing rates of locoregional recurrence. OBJECTIVE To assess the efficacy of FV-guided surgery in reducing locoregional recurrence and improving overall survival. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A retrospective, case-control observational studywas conducted on patients registered at a single oral oncology clinic from September 1, 2004, to August 31, 2009. The study included 246 patients 18 years or older with a diagnosis of a high-grade lesion (severe dysplasia or carcinoma in situ) or squamous cell carcinoma of less than 4 cmwho underwent curative surgical treatment with at least 1 follow-up visit. Among these patients, 154 underwent surgery with FV guidance (FV group) and the other 92 underwent conventional surgery (control group). Demographic and lesional characteristics and outcomes were collected, and the key factors for the efficacy of FV-guided surgery were examined. Follow-up was completed on December 31, 2011, and data were analyzed from May 1 to November 30, 2013. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Local recurrence of oral lesions with a histologic grade of severe dysplasia or higher, the presence of regional failure (ie, ametastatic lesion in the cervical lymph nodes), or disease-free survival after surgery. RESULTS Among the 246 patients included in the study (mean [SD] age, 60 [12] years; 108 women and 138 men), 156 had squamous cell carcinoma and 90 had high-grade lesions. There were no significant differences between the FV (n = 154) and control (n = 92) groups in age, smoking history, anatomical site of the lesion, tumor size, and previous oral cancer. Among the 156 patients with squamous cell carcinoma, the 92 patients in the FV group showed significant reduction in the 3-year local recurrence rate, from 40.6%(26 of 64 patients) to 6.5%(6 of 92 patients) (P <.001). Among the 90 patients with high-grade lesions, the 62 patients in the FV group showed a reduction in local recurrence rate from 11 of 28 patients (39.3%) to 5 of 62 patients (8.1%) (P <.001). The data also indicated that, compared with conventional surgery, the FV-guided approach for squamous cell carcinoma was associated with less regional failure (14 of 92 patients [15.2%] vs 16 of 64 [25.0%]; P =.08) and death (12 of 92 patients [13.0%] vs 13 of 64 [20.3%]; P =.22), although these differences were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this study, the use of FV as part of the surgical margin decision process significantly reduced the rate of local recurrence in preinvasive high-grade and early-stage oral cancers. An ongoing multicenter, phase 3, randomized surgical trial has completed accrual, and the data will be used to validate the results of this study. © 2016 American Medical Association.

AB  - Purpose: Application of ultrasensitive diagnostics has shown that small numbers of p53 mutation-positive cells may signify the presence of residual tumor in histologically normal tissues after resection of squamous cell carcinomas arising in the head and neck area. To date, most studies in this area have focused on analysis of tissues at the mucosal aspect of the resection and highlighted the importance of molecular changes in the field with respect to the risk of recurrence. Experimental Design: In the present investigation, we analyzed normal tissues from mucosal and deep surgical margins, referred to as "molecular margins," for the presence of the signature p53 mutation identified for each tumor. Results: The p53 mutation status of these carcinomas did not correlate with clinical or histopathologic variables, but these mutations provided an excellent target for ultrasensitive analysis of margin status. We found that 11 of 16 (68%) of cases with histologically tumor-free (including 9 without dysplasia), but with p53 mutation-positive molecular margins, developed recurrence. The probability of developing local recurrence was significantly higher for the group with p53 mutation-positive margins when compared with the group with clear margins (P = 0.048) and more strongly associated with p53 mutation-positive deep molecular margins than mutation-positive mucosal molecular margins or positivity at both sites (P = 0.009). Conclusions: This shows that although persistent mucosal fields may contribute to recurrence, clonal p53 mutations in deep tissues are an important cause of treatment failure, and molecular margins from both sites should be analyzed in future prospective series. ©2007 American Association for Cancer Research.

AB  - IMPORTANCE There is a lack of consistency in the literature regarding the definition of "close" resection margins in the surgical treatment of oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OCSCC), and the relationship between local recurrence (LR) rates and different distances of invasive tumor from surgical margin is not well characterized. OBJECTIVE To analyze the association between specific distances from invasive tumor to surgical margin and LR in patients with OCSCC. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective cohort study of 432 patients treated via en bloc resection for OCSCC between 2005 and 2014 at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics. In all cases, permanent margin evaluation was performed on the main tumor specimen and with intraoperative frozen section margin assessment from the tumor bed. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The LR rate based on minimum millimeter distance between invasive tumor and inked main specimen margin. RESULTS Of the 432 participants, 252 (58%) were men and 180 (42%) were women (mean age, 62.14 years; range, 19-99 years). In each case, the LR rate was analyzed in relation to each millimeter distance of invasive cancer from the inked main specimen margin, with results showing an exponential inverse relationship. The LR rate for microscopic positive margins was 44%(95%CI, 34%-55%); for margins less than 1 mm, 28%(95%CI, 18%-41%); for 1 mm, 17%(95%CI, 8%-31%); for 2 mm, 13%(95%CI, 6%-27%); for 3 mm, 13%(95%CI, 5%-32%); for 4 mm, 14%(95%CI, 5%-35%); and for 5mmor greater, 11% (95%CI, 6%-18%). Analysis of the receiver operating characteristic curve identified a cutoff of less than 1mmas appropriate for classifying higher risk of local recurrence. Regardless of margin distance, resection of additional tissue beyond 1mmbased on intraoperative frozen section was not associated with improved local control. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The commonly used cutoff of 5mmfor a close margin lacks an evidential basis in predicting local recurrence. Invasive tumor within 1mmof the permanent specimen margin is associated with a significantly higher local recurrence rate, though there is no significant difference for greater distances. This study suggests that a cutoff of less than 1mmidentifies patients at increased local recurrence risk who may benefit from additional treatment. Analysis of the tumor specimen rather than the tumor bed is necessary for this determination. © 2017 American Medical Association.

AB  - The intraoperative knowledge of margin status on mandibulectomy specimens is important for primary reconstruction. The goal of this study was to evaluate whether intraoperative bone marrow (BM) curettings and inferior alveolar nerve (IAN) biopsies are representative of final decalcified cross-sectional (shave) mandibular bone margins. Forty-seven margins in 27 patients consecutively treated with segmental mandibulectomy for squamous cell carcinoma were reviewed. These patients had BM or IAN margins sampled by surgeons and assessed intraoperatively by routine frozen section. The full cross-section of mandibular bone margins were sampled by pathologists at the time of routine gross examination. Intraoperative evaluation of BM/IAN biopsies is characterized by a 50% sensitivity (3 of 6 cases were false negative) and a 100% specificity. IAN biopsies are representative of the final bone margin. Given the technical feasibility of intraoperative BM and IAN assessment, we favor routine intraoperative evaluation of mandibular bone margins. However, even when bone margins are sampled intraoperatively, obtaining a full cross-section of the bone margin at the time of gross examination should also be performed as it remains the most accurate modality of bone margin assessment. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the clinical usefulness of intraoral sonography-assisted resection for securing adequate deep resection margins in T1-2 tongue cancers. Study Design: Prospective clinical trial. Materials and Methods: Twenty consecutive patients with clinical T1-2 tongue cancers were enrolled and their lesions were removed by intraoral sonography-assisted resection. We then retrospectively collected data from 20 T stage-matched patients without intraoral sonography-assisted resection as the control group. All resections were performed with a goal of 15 mm margin. The mucosal and deep safety margins were compared between the two groups. Results: Intraoral sonography could predict the paraffin-embedded tumor thickness with an error of 3.16 ± 2.24 mm. The deep safety margins were more adequate for intraoral sonography-assisted resection (9.8 ± 5.2 mm) than for conventional resection (4.0 ± 2.03 mm) (P < 0.001), while the mucosal safety margins were not different. Conclusion: Intraoral sonography-assisted resection provides a more adequate deep resection margin for early T-stage tongue cancers. © 2008 American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation.

AB  - Abstract Background Resecting oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) with an appropriate margin of uninvolved tissue is critical in preventing local recurrence and in making decisions regarding postoperative radiation therapy. This task can be difficult due to the discrepancy between margins measured intraoperatively and those measured microscopically by the pathologist after specimen processing. Material and methods A total of 61 patients underwent resective surgery with curative intent for primary oral SCC were included in this study. All patients underwent resection of the tumor with a measured 1-cm margin. Specimens were then submitted for processing and reviewing, and histopathologic margins were measured. The closest histopathologic margin was compared with the in situ margin (1 cm) to determine the percentage discrepancy. Results The mean discrepancy between the in situ margins and the histopathological margins of all close and positive margins were 47.6% for the buccal mucosa (with a P value corresponding to 0.05 equaling 2.1), which is statistically significant, 4.8% for the floor of mouth, 9.5% for the mandibular alveolus, 4.8% for the retromolar trigon, and 33.3% for the tongue. Conclusion There is a significant difference among resection margins based on tumor anatomical location. Margins shrinkage after resection and processing should be considered at the time of the initial resection. Tumors located in the buccal mucosa show significantly greater discrepancies than tumors at other sites. These findings suggest that it is critical to consider the oral site when outlining margins to ensure adequacy of resection. Buccal SCC is an aggressive disease, and should be considered as an aggressive subsite within the oral cavity, requiring a radical and aggressive resective approach. © 2015 European Association for Cranio-Maxillo-Facial Surgery.

AB  - This review will discuss the aspects of stem cell biology that can contribute to explain tumor development and why standard oncology treatments sometimes fail. We also propose an integrated model of tumor progression based on the putative occurrence of Stem Cell Networks (SCNs). In a SCN, the somatic stem cells are derived from a common embryonic stem cell, share a specific molecular profile and maintain a high degree of cell-cycle synchronization. In the study of cancer, the SCN model introduces an additional conceptual frame to the interpretation of both the cancer stem cell (CSC) hypothesis and the field cancerization concept. The CSC model may explain how the cancer fields develop, justifies their sizes and shapes, contribute to explain the local recurrences in patients with free margins, the second primary tumors, the success of organ preserving surgical approaches or the trend of different tumors to metastasize to certain locations. We propose that the SCN model of cancer provides some clues for further understanding tumor progression and raises promising experimental and clinical implications. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Objectives/Hypothesis High-resolution microendoscopy (HRME) provides real-time visualization of the mucosal surface in the upper aerodigestive tract. This technology allows noninvasive discrimination of benign and neoplastic epithelium and has potential applications for intraoperative margin detection. Study Design Single institution, prospective, feasibility trial (phase I) of in vivo optical imaging. Methods The study was conducted on patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the upper aerodigestive tract. High-resolution microendoscopy images obtained during surgery were correlated with histopathologic diagnosis to determine the ability of HRME to differentiate between benign and malignant mucosa. Blinded reviewers evaluated HRME images and made determinations of the status of the mucosa. Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and interrater agreement between multiple raters were calculated to determine the accuracy of HRME imaging. Results The mean accuracy of reviewers in differentiating neoplastic or benign mucosa was 95.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 94%-96 %). Sensitivity and specificity were 96% (95% CI, 94%-99 %) and 95% (95 % CI, 90%-99 %), respectively. The NPV was 98% (95% CI, 97%-99%), and PPV was 91% (95% CI, 85%-98%). The Fleiss kappa statistic for interrater reliability was 0.81, with a standard error of 0.014 and a 95% CI (0.78-0.84). Conclusion High-resolution microendoscopy allows real-time discrimination between benign and neoplastic mucosa. High levels of sensitivity and specificity can be obtained with this technology when interrogating mucosal surfaces. Despite several technical limitations, HRME shows promise as a technique for intraoperative margin control and platform for molecular imaging technologies. © 2015 The American Laryngological, Rhinological and Otological Society, Inc.

AB  - Objectives: Supracricoid laryngectomy (SCL) is a reliable laryngeal preservation surgery. However, close surgical margins are often inevitable. Based on clinicopathological analyses of supracricoid laryngectomized specimens, we evaluated the evidence base supporting minimal margins. Methods: The distance between tumor edge and resected margin was measured macro- and microscopically at the anterior, posterior, superior and inferior edges, using 50 surgical specimens. The margins were correlated with pathological T staging and the prognoses. Results: The anterior and posterior margins were the shortest, and the superior margin was the longest. The inferior margin was the only edge at which a positive margin was encountered. Cancer extending 10 mm below the glottal free edge significantly decreased the inferior margin. Conclusions: The surgical potential of SCL with cricohyoidoepiglottopexy was confirmed to be able to cope with tumor extensions showing margins of a few millimeters at the anterior, posterior and superior ends. Accurate assessment and management at the inferior margin is the key to stable local control. © 2009 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - Background: The purpose of this study was to validate the prognostic value of adding narrow-band imaging (NBI) during transoral laser surgery (TLS) for early glottic cancer. Methods: In 84 patients, 93 transoral laser resections were performed for carcinoma in situ (Tcis), T1, or T2 glottic cancer. TLS was preceded by intraoperative evaluation using traditional white-light imaging (WLI) in 51 cases. In 42 cases, NBI was used in addition to WLI. Local recurrence rate and recurrence-free survival were retrospectively compared between both groups. Results: Local recurrences developed in 14% of the 93 cases: 12 of 51 patients (24%) were treated by TLS based on WLI alone, and in 1 of 42 patients (2%) in the NBI group (P <.01). Two-year recurrence-free survival was 82% in the WLI group and 98% in the NBI group (P <.05). Conclusion: Additional use of NBI during TLS for early glottic cancer significantly improves clinical outcome. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Background. Tissue imprinting can generate molecular marker maps of tumor cells at deep surgical margins. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of this method for detection of residual head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Methods. Paired fresh tissue and nitrocellulose membrane imprints of tumor and deep margins were collected from 17 HNSCC resections. DNA was amplified using quantitative methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (qMSP) for p16, DCC, KIF1A, and EDNRB. Levels of methylation in tumors and deep margins were compared. Results. DNA from imprints was adequate for qMSP. Hypermethylation of target genes was present in 12 of 17 tumors and in 8 deep margins. Methylation level was better from margin imprints than tissue. During follow-up (median, 13 months), local or regional recurrences occurred in 6 cases of which 5 had molecularly positive margins. Conclusion. Tissue imprinting is feasible for molecular detection of residual tumor at deep surgical margins and may correlate with locoregional recurrence. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to estimate the width of free margin with a significant impact on local recurrence in surgical resection of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Clinical and pathological data of 127 consecutive patients who underwent radical resection of OSCC were analyzed retrospectively. The local control rate was compared between patients with clear, close, and involved surgical margins, changing the required width of free margin for the definition of ‘close surgical margin’ (from 1 to 5 mm). If a free margin of within 1, 2, or 4 mm was judged a close margin, the risk of local recurrence was significantly different among the patients with clear, close, and involved surgical margins. If the definition of close margin was within 5 mm of the resection margin, the difference between clear and close margin did not reach statistical significance. The results of this study suggest that 5 mm of clearance at the surgical resection margin should be the index of oncological surgery. More than 5 mm of histological free margin around OSCC is not justified in terms of the risk management of local recurrence and the resultant morbidity. © 2015 International Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons

AB  - Purpose To quantify changes in tumor size and tumor-free margins following surgical resection and formalin fixation of oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma. Materials and methods Nineteen patients were studied via cohort design. Between May and December 2011, measurements of tumor size and tumor-free margin were made in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity. Mucosal reference points were marked with sutures, representing tumor diameter and two separate resection margins. Measurements were recorded immediately before resection, after resection, and following fixation in formalin. Results The overall mean shrinkage in tumor size was 10.7% (95% CI 3.4–18.0, p = 0.006). When comparing mean tumor measurements, most of the tumor size decrease (6.4%, 95% CI 0.4–12.4, p = 0.039) occurred between pre- and post-excision measurements. To a lesser extent, tumor size decreased following formalin fixation. Comparison of tumor-free margin measurements revealed a pre-excision to post-fixation mean decrease of 11.3% (95% CI 2.9–19.6%, p = 0.011), with a statistically significant decrease of 14.9% (95% CI 8.5–21.3%, p < 0.001) occurring between pre- and post-excision, and no significant decrease from post-excision to post-formalin fixation. Conclusion Mucosal dimensions of both tumor and tumor-free margins in oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma specimens decrease between surgical resection and pathologic analysis. Most of this decrease occurs prior to fixation, especially for margins, and may be due to intrinsic tissue properties rather than formalin effects. © 2017

AB  - Frozen section is routinely used for intraoperative margin evaluation in carcinomas of the head and neck. We studied a series of frozen sections performed for margin status of head and neck tumors to determine diagnostic accuracy. All frozen sections for margin control of squamous carcinomas of the head and neck were studied from a 66 month period. Frozen and permanent section diagnoses were classified as negative or malignant. Correlation of diagnoses was performed to determine accuracy. One thousand seven hundred and ninety-six pairs of frozen section and corresponding permanent section diagnoses were obtained. Discordances were found in 55 (3.1%) pairs. In 35 pairs (1.9%), frozen section was reported as benign, but permanent sections disclosed carcinoma. In 21 cases, the discrepancy was due to sampling and in the remaining cases it was an interpretive error. In 20 cases (1.1%), frozen section was malignant, but the permanent section was interpreted as negative. Frozen section is an accurate method for evaluation of operative margins for head and neck carcinomas with concordance between frozen and permanent results of 97%. Most errors are false negative results with the majority of these being due to sampling issues. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - Oral cancer is a public health problem with relevant incidence in the world population. The affected patient usually presents advanced stage disease and the consequence of this delay is a reduction in survival rates. Given this, it is essential to detect oral cancer at early stages. Fluorescence spectroscopy is a non-invasive diagnostic tool that can improve cancer detection in real time. It is a fast and accurate technique, relatively simple, which evaluates the biochemical composition and structure using the tissue fluorescence spectrum as interrogation data. Several studies have positive data regarding the tools for differentiating between normal mucosa and cancer, but the difference between cancer and potentially malignant disorders is not clear.The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of fluorescence spectroscopy in the discrimination of normal oral mucosa, oral cancer, and potentially malignant disorders.The fluorescence spectroscopy was evaluated in 115 individuals, of whom 55 patients presented oral squamous cell carcinoma, 30 volunteers showing normal oral mucosa, and 30 patients having potentially malignant disorders. The spectra were classified and compared to histopathology to evaluate the efficiency in diagnostic discrimination employing fluorescence. In order to classify the spectra, a decision tree algorithm (C4.5) was applied. Despite of the high variance observed in spectral data, the specificity and sensitivity obtained were 93.8% and 88.5%, respectively at 406. nm excitation. These results point to the potential use of fluorescence spectroscopy as an important tool for oral cancer diagnosis and potentially malignant disorders. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The intraoperative cytological assessment of bony resection margins (ICAB) is a feasible diagnostic approach to support frozen section for assessment of invasion of margins of soft and hard tissue. However, complex resection margins could challenge both diagnostic approaches. Our objective here was to identify the limitations of intraoperative diagnostic methods for assessing margins. We present an advanced cytological approach to assess complex margins that may solve the problem. Data from 119 patients in whom frozen section was supported by ICAB, were reviewed and the reasons for false results analysed. In 35 patients with squamous cell carcinoma infiltrating bone, specimens (n=100) from the resection margin went through an intraoperative cell isolation process for the cytological assessment of bony margins (ICAB). The results were compared with the histological results of the corresponding margins of bone as a reference. Limitations to the assessment of operative bony margins intraoperatively included an infiltrative histological pattern of growth of the carcinoma, with carcinoma cells disseminated within the cancellous bone, complex and uneven resection margins with soft and bony tissue, inflammation, and signs of previous radiotherapy. Intraoperative cell isolation plus (ICICAB) allowed the microscopic assessment of up to 1 cm3 of bony tissue to detect disseminated carcinoma cells within the cancellous bone with a sensitivity of 92.3% (95% CI 74.9% to 99.1%), and a specificity of 100% (95% CI 95.1% to 100%), and positive and negative predictive values of 100% (95% CI 85.8% to 100%) and 97.4% (95%CI 90.8% to 99.7%), respectively. Intraoperative cell isolation is a feasible new technique to support ICAB and frozen section in the assessment of bony and soft tissue margins. © 2017 The British Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons

AB  - Background: The surgeon's evaluation of resection status based on frozen section analysis during operation and pathological examination of resected specimens often differ. For this study, we recapitulated the surgeon's perspective during an operation, accordingly classified the evaluation of margins by the surgeon, and analyzed its impact on the outcome compared with the pathological results. Methods: This was a retrospective analysis. As data sources, paper-based and digital patient files, as well as the Munich Cancer Registry database were used. Results: Three hundred ninety-six cases were included in this analysis. Only the evaluation of margins by the surgeon influenced local control, and the pathological results influenced disease-free survival (DFS). Surprisingly, margins of >5 mm of normal tissue to cancer growth led to local control and overall survival (OS) significantly worse than 1 to 5-mm resections. Conclusion: The evaluation of margins by the surgeon is of significant importance for local control and OS. It is largely based on frozen section analysis, which, therefore, should be used whenever possible. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Objectives/Hypothesis: The diagnostic gain of narrow band imaging in the definition of surgical margins in the treatment of head and neck cancer was evaluated. Study Design: A prospective study, blinded to the pathologist, with historical comparison. Methods: The study group included 45 patients subjected to the intraoperative definition of margins by narrow band imaging. The control group included 55 patients who had undergone standard definition of margins. All patients underwent resection of the tumor and frozen section analysis of superficial margins. The rate of initial R0 resection and the ratio of histologically negative margins for both groups were statistically compared. Results: The rate of initial R0 resection in the study group and in the control group was 88.9% and 70.9% (P =.047), and the ratio of histologically negative margins was 95.9% and 88.4% (P =.017), respectively. Conclusions: Narrow band imaging reveals a microscopic extension of the tumor that could be effectively used to better define superficial margins and to achieve a higher rate of initial R0 resections.
